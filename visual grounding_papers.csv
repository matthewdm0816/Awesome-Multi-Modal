Meta Compositional Referring Expression Segmentation,"Referring expression segmentation aims to segment an object described by a language expression from an image. Despite the recent progress on this task, existing models tackling this task may not be able to fully capture semantics and visual representations of individual concepts, which limits their generalization capability, especially when handling novel compositions of learned concepts. In this work, through the lens of meta learning, we propose a Meta Compositional Referring Expression Segmentation (MCRES) framework to enhance model compositional generalization performance. Specifically, to handle various levels of novel compositions, our framework first uses training data to construct a virtual training set and multiple virtual testing sets, where data samples in each virtual testing set contain a level of novel compositions w.r.t. the support set. Then, following a novel meta optimization scheme to optimize the model to obtain good testing performance on the virtual testing sets after training on the virtual training set, our framework can effectively drive the model to better capture semantics and visual representations of individual concepts, and thus obtain robust generalization performance even when handling novel compositions. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Xu_Meta_Compositional_Referring_Expression_Segmentation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
PolyFormer: Referring Image Segmentation As Sequential Polygon Generation,"In this work, instead of directly predicting the pixel-level segmentation masks, the problem of referring image segmentation is formulated as sequential polygon generation, and the predicted polygons can be later converted into segmentation masks. This is enabled by a new sequence-to-sequence framework, Polygon Transformer (PolyFormer), which takes a sequence of image patches and text query tokens as input, and outputs a sequence of polygon vertices autoregressively. For more accurate geometric localization, we propose a regression-based decoder, which predicts the precise floating-point coordinates directly, without any coordinate quantization error. In the experiments, PolyFormer outperforms the prior art by a clear margin, e.g., 5.40% and 4.52% absolute improvements on the challenging RefCOCO+ and RefCOCOg datasets. It also shows strong generalization ability when evaluated on the referring video segmentation task without fine-tuning, e.g., achieving competitive 61.5% J&F on the Ref-DAVIS17 dataset.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Liu_PolyFormer_Referring_Image_Segmentation_As_Sequential_Polygon_Generation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning To Generate Language-Supervised and Open-Vocabulary Scene Graph Using Pre-Trained Visual-Semantic Space,"Scene graph generation (SGG) aims to abstract an image into a graph structure, by representing objects as graph nodes and their relations as labeled edges. However, two knotty obstacles limit the practicability of current SGG methods in real-world scenarios: 1) training SGG models requires time-consuming ground-truth annotations, and 2) the closed-set object categories make the SGG models limited in their ability to recognize novel objects outside of training corpora. To address these issues, we novelly exploit a powerful pre-trained visual-semantic space (VSS) to trigger language-supervised and open-vocabulary SGG in a simple yet effective manner. Specifically, cheap scene graph supervision data can be easily obtained by parsing image language descriptions into semantic graphs. Next, the noun phrases on such semantic graphs are directly grounded over image regions through region-word alignment in the pre-trained VSS. In this way, we enable open-vocabulary object detection by performing object category name grounding with a text prompt in this VSS. On the basis of visually-grounded objects, the relation representations are naturally built for relation recognition, pursuing open-vocabulary SGG. We validate our proposed approach with extensive experiments on the Visual Genome benchmark across various SGG scenarios (i.e., supervised / language-supervised, closed-set / open-vocabulary). Consistent superior performances are achieved compared with existing methods, demonstrating the potential of exploiting pre-trained VSS for SGG in more practical scenarios.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zhang_Learning_To_Generate_Language-Supervised_and_Open-Vocabulary_Scene_Graph_Using_Pre-Trained_CVPR_2023_paper.html
DeCo: Decomposition and Reconstruction for Compositional Temporal Grounding via Coarse-To-Fine Contrastive Ranking,"Understanding dense action in videos is a fundamental challenge towards the generalization of vision models. Several works show that compositionality is key to achieving generalization by combining known primitive elements, especially for handling novel composited structures. Compositional temporal grounding is the task of localizing dense action by using known words combined in novel ways in the form of novel query sentences for the actual grounding. In recent works, composition is assumed to be learned from pairs of whole videos and language embeddings through large scale self-supervised pre-training. Alternatively, one can process the video and language into word-level primitive elements, and then only learn fine-grained semantic correspondences. Both approaches do not consider the granularity of the compositions, where different query granularity corresponds to different video segments. Therefore, a good compositional representation should be sensitive to different video and query granularity. We propose a method to learn a coarse-to-fine compositional representation by decomposing the original query sentence into different granular levels, and then learning the correct correspondences between the video and recombined queries through a contrastive ranking constraint. Additionally, we run temporal boundary prediction in a coarse-to-fine manner for precise grounding boundary detection. Experiments are performed on two datasets Charades-CG and ActivityNet-CG showing the superior compositional generalizability of our approach.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yang_DeCo_Decomposition_and_Reconstruction_for_Compositional_Temporal_Grounding_via_Coarse-To-Fine_CVPR_2023_paper.html
NS3D: Neuro-Symbolic Grounding of 3D Objects and Relations,"Grounding object properties and relations in 3D scenes is a prerequisite for a wide range of artificial intelligence tasks, such as visually grounded dialogues and embodied manipulation. However, the variability of the 3D domain induces two fundamental challenges: 1) the expense of labeling and 2) the complexity of 3D grounded language. Hence, essential desiderata for models are to be data-efficient, generalize to different data distributions and tasks with unseen semantic forms, as well as ground complex language semantics (e.g., view-point anchoring and multi-object reference). To address these challenges, we propose NS3D, a neuro-symbolic framework for 3D grounding. NS3D translates language into programs with hierarchical structures by leveraging large language-to-code models. Different functional modules in the programs are implemented as neural networks. Notably, NS3D extends prior neuro-symbolic visual reasoning methods by introducing functional modules that effectively reason about high-arity relations (i.e., relations among more than two objects), key in disambiguating objects in complex 3D scenes. Modular and compositional architecture enables NS3D to achieve state-of-the-art results on the ReferIt3D view-dependence task, a 3D referring expression comprehension benchmark. Importantly, NS3D shows significantly improved performance on settings of data-efficiency and generalization, and demonstrate zero-shot transfer to an unseen 3D question-answering task.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Hsu_NS3D_Neuro-Symbolic_Grounding_of_3D_Objects_and_Relations_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Dynamic Inference With Grounding Based Vision and Language Models,"Transformers have been recently utilized for vision and language tasks successfully. For example, recent image and language models with more than 200M parameters have been proposed to learn visual grounding in the pre-training step and show impressive results on downstream vision and language tasks. On the other hand, there exists a large amount of computational redundancy in these large models which skips their run-time efficiency. To address this problem, we propose dynamic inference for grounding based vision and language models conditioned on the input image-text pair. We first design an approach to dynamically skip multihead self-attention and feed forward network layers across two backbones and multimodal network. Additionally, we propose dynamic token pruning and fusion for two backbones. In particular, we remove redundant tokens at different levels of the backbones and fuse the image tokens with the language tokens in an adaptive manner. To learn policies for dynamic inference, we train agents using reinforcement learning. In this direction, we replace the CNN backbone in a recent grounding-based vision and language model, MDETR, with a vision transformer and call it ViTMDETR. Then, we apply our dynamic inference method to ViTMDETR, called D-ViTDMETR, and perform experiments on image-language tasks. Our results show that we can improve the run-time efficiency of the state-of-the-art models MDETR and GLIP by up to  50% on Referring Expression Comprehension and Segmentation, and VQA with only maximum  0.3% accuracy drop.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Uzkent_Dynamic_Inference_With_Grounding_Based_Vision_and_Language_Models_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Connecting Vision and Language With Video Localized Narratives,"We propose Video Localized Narratives, a new form of multimodal video annotations connecting vision and language. In the original Localized Narratives, annotators speak and move their mouse simultaneously on an image, thus grounding each word with a mouse trace segment. However, this is challenging on a video. Our new protocol empowers annotators to tell the story of a video with Localized Narratives, capturing even complex events involving multiple actors interacting with each other and with several passive objects. We annotated 20k videos of the OVIS, UVO, and Oops datasets, totalling 1.7M words. Based on this data, we also construct new benchmarks for the video narrative grounding and video question answering tasks, and provide reference results from strong baseline models. Our annotations are available at https://google.github.io/video-localized-narratives/.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Voigtlaender_Connecting_Vision_and_Language_With_Video_Localized_Narratives_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Hierarchical Semantic Correspondence Networks for Video Paragraph Grounding,"Video Paragraph Grounding (VPG) is an essential yet challenging task in vision-language understanding, which aims to jointly localize multiple events from an untrimmed video with a paragraph query description. One of the critical challenges in addressing this problem is to comprehend the complex semantic relations between visual and textual modalities. Previous methods focus on modeling the contextual information between the video and text from a single-level perspective (i.e., the sentence level), ignoring rich visual-textual correspondence relations at different semantic levels, e.g., the video-word and video-paragraph correspondence. To this end, we propose a novel Hierarchical Semantic Correspondence Network (HSCNet), which explores multi-level visual-textual correspondence by learning hierarchical semantic alignment and utilizes dense supervision by grounding diverse levels of queries. Specifically, we develop a hierarchical encoder that encodes the multi-modal inputs into semantics-aligned representations at different levels. To exploit the hierarchical semantic correspondence learned in the encoder for multi-level supervision, we further design a hierarchical decoder that progressively performs finer grounding for lower-level queries conditioned on higher-level semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of HSCNet and our method significantly outstrips the state-of-the-arts on two challenging benchmarks, i.e., ActivityNet-Captions and TACoS.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Tan_Hierarchical_Semantic_Correspondence_Networks_for_Video_Paragraph_Grounding_CVPR_2023_paper.html
DATE: Domain Adaptive Product Seeker for E-Commerce,"Product Retrieval (PR) and Grounding (PG), aiming to seek image and object-level products respectively according to a textual query, have attracted great interest recently for better shopping experience. Owing to the lack of relevant datasets, we collect two large-scale benchmark datasets from Taobao Mall and Live domains with about 474k and 101k image-query pairs for PR, and manually annotate the object bounding boxes in each image for PG. As annotating boxes is expensive and time-consuming, we attempt to transfer knowledge from annotated domain to unannotated for PG to achieve un-supervised Domain Adaptation (PG-DA). We propose a Domain Adaptive producT sEeker (DATE) framework, regarding PR and PG as Product Seeking problem at different levels, to assist the query date the product. Concretely, we first design a semantics-aggregated feature extractor for each modality to obtain concentrated and comprehensive features for following efficient retrieval and fine-grained grounding tasks. Then, we present two cooperative seekers to simultaneously search the image for PR and localize the product for PG. Besides, we devise a domain aligner for PG-DA to alleviate uni-modal marginal and multi-modal conditional distribution shift between source and target domains, and design a pseudo box generator to dynamically select reliable instances and generate bounding boxes for further knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments show that our DATE achieves satisfactory performance in fully-supervised PR, PG and un-supervised PG-DA. Our desensitized datasets will be publicly available here https://github.com/Taobao-live/Product-Seeking.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Li_DATE_Domain_Adaptive_Product_Seeker_for_E-Commerce_CVPR_2023_paper.html
WINNER: Weakly-Supervised hIerarchical decompositioN and aligNment for Spatio-tEmporal Video gRounding,"Spatio-temporal video grounding aims to localize the aligned visual tube corresponding to a language query. Existing techniques achieve such alignment by exploiting dense boundary and bounding box annotations, which can be prohibitively expensive. To bridge the gap, we investigate the weakly-supervised setting, where models learn from easily accessible video-language data without annotations. We identify that intra-sample spurious correlations among video-language components can be alleviated if the model captures the decomposed structures of video and language data. In this light, we propose a novel framework, namely WINNER, for hierarchical video-text understanding. WINNER first builds the language decomposition tree in a bottom-up manner, upon which the structural attention mechanism and top-down feature backtracking jointly build a multi-modal decomposition tree, permitting a hierarchical understanding of unstructured videos. The multi-modal decomposition tree serves as the basis for multi-hierarchy language-tube matching. A hierarchical contrastive learning objective is proposed to learn the multi-hierarchy correspondence and distinguishment with intra-sample and inter-sample video-text decomposition structures, achieving video-language decomposition structure alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate the rationality of our design and its effectiveness beyond state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods, even some supervised methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Li_WINNER_Weakly-Supervised_hIerarchical_decompositioN_and_aligNment_for_Spatio-tEmporal_Video_gRounding_CVPR_2023_paper.html
GRES: Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation,"Referring Expression Segmentation (RES) aims to generate a segmentation mask for the object described by a given language expression. Existing classic RES datasets and methods commonly support single-target expressions only, i.e., one expression refers to one target object. Multi-target and no-target expressions are not considered. This limits the usage of RES in practice. In this paper, we introduce a new benchmark called Generalized Referring Expression Segmentation (GRES), which extends the classic RES to allow expressions to refer to an arbitrary number of target objects. Towards this, we construct the first large-scale GRES dataset called gRefCOCO that contains multi-target, no-target, and single-target expressions. GRES and gRefCOCO are designed to be well-compatible with RES, facilitating extensive experiments to study the performance gap of the existing RES methods on the GRES task. In the experimental study, we find that one of the big challenges of GRES is complex relationship modeling. Based on this, we propose a region-based GRES baseline ReLA that adaptively divides the image into regions with sub-instance clues, and explicitly models the region-region and region-language dependencies. The proposed approach ReLA achieves new state-of-the-art performance on the both newly proposed GRES and classic RES tasks. The proposed gRefCOCO dataset and method are available at https://henghuiding.github.io/GRES.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Liu_GRES_Generalized_Referring_Expression_Segmentation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Collaborative Static and Dynamic Vision-Language Streams for Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding,"Spatio-Temporal Video Grounding (STVG) aims to localize the target object spatially and temporally according to the given language query. It is a challenging task in which the model should well understand dynamic visual cues (e.g., motions) and static visual cues (e.g., object appearances) in the language description, which requires effective joint modeling of spatio-temporal visual-linguistic dependencies. In this work, we propose a novel framework in which a static vision-language stream and a dynamic vision-language stream are developed to collaboratively reason the target tube. The static stream performs cross-modal understanding in a single frame and learns to attend to the target object spatially according to intra-frame visual cues like object appearances. The dynamic stream models visual-linguistic dependencies across multiple consecutive frames to capture dynamic cues like motions. We further design a novel cross-stream collaborative block between the two streams, which enables the static and dynamic streams to transfer useful and complementary information from each other to achieve collaborative reasoning. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the collaboration of the two streams and our overall framework achieves new state-of-the-art performance on both HCSTVG and VidSTG datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Lin_Collaborative_Static_and_Dynamic_Vision-Language_Streams_for_Spatio-Temporal_Video_Grounding_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Language Adaptive Weight Generation for Multi-Task Visual Grounding,"Although the impressive performance in visual grounding, the prevailing approaches usually exploit the visual backbone in a passive way, i.e., the visual backbone extracts features with fixed weights without expression-related hints. The passive perception may lead to mismatches (e.g., redundant and missing), limiting further performance improvement. Ideally, the visual backbone should actively extract visual features since the expressions already provide the blueprint of desired visual features. The active perception can take expressions as priors to extract relevant visual features, which can effectively alleviate the mismatches. Inspired by this, we propose an active perception Visual Grounding framework based on Language Adaptive Weights, called VG-LAW. The visual backbone serves as an expression-specific feature extractor through dynamic weights generated for various expressions. Benefiting from the specific and relevant visual features extracted from the language-aware visual backbone, VG-LAW does not require additional modules for cross-modal interaction. Along with a neat multi-task head, VG-LAW can be competent in referring expression comprehension and segmentation jointly. Extensive experiments on four representative datasets, i.e., RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg, and ReferItGame, validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Su_Language_Adaptive_Weight_Generation_for_Multi-Task_Visual_Grounding_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Similarity Maps for Self-Training Weakly-Supervised Phrase Grounding,"A phrase grounding model receives an input image and a text phrase and outputs a suitable localization map. We present an effective way to refine a phrase ground model by considering self-similarity maps extracted from the latent representation of the model's image encoder. Our main insights are that these maps resemble localization maps and that by combining such maps, one can obtain useful pseudo-labels for performing self-training. Our results surpass, by a large margin, the state-of-the-art in weakly supervised phrase grounding. A similar gap in performance is obtained for a recently proposed downstream task called WWbL, in which the input image is given without any text. Our code is available as supplementary.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Shaharabany_Similarity_Maps_for_Self-Training_Weakly-Supervised_Phrase_Grounding_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Universal Instance Perception As Object Discovery and Retrieval,"All instance perception tasks aim at finding certain objects specified by some queries such as category names, language expressions, and target annotations, but this complete field has been split into multiple independent subtasks. In this work, we present a universal instance perception model of the next generation, termed UNINEXT. UNINEXT reformulates diverse instance perception tasks into a unified object discovery and retrieval paradigm and can flexibly perceive different types of objects by simply changing the input prompts. This unified formulation brings the following benefits: (1) enormous data from different tasks and label vocabularies can be exploited for jointly training general instance-level representations, which is especially beneficial for tasks lacking in training data. (2) the unified model is parameter-efficient and can save redundant computation when handling multiple tasks simultaneously. UNINEXT shows superior performance on 20 challenging benchmarks from 10 instance-level tasks including classical image-level tasks (object detection and instance segmentation), vision-and-language tasks (referring expression comprehension and segmentation), and six video-level object tracking tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/MasterBin-IIAU/UNINEXT.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yan_Universal_Instance_Perception_As_Object_Discovery_and_Retrieval_CVPR_2023_paper.html
RefCLIP: A Universal Teacher for Weakly Supervised Referring Expression Comprehension,"Referring Expression Comprehension (REC) is a task of grounding the referent based on an expression, and its development is greatly limited by expensive instance-level annotations. Most existing weakly supervised methods are built based on two-stage detection networks, which are computationally expensive. In this paper, we resort to the efficient one-stage detector and propose a novel weakly supervised model called RefCLIP. Specifically, RefCLIP redefines weakly supervised REC as an anchor-text matching problem, which can avoid the complex post-processing in existing methods. To achieve weakly supervised learning, we introduce anchor-based contrastive loss to optimize RefCLIP via numerous anchor-text pairs. Based on RefCLIP, we further propose the first model-agnostic weakly supervised training scheme for existing REC models, where RefCLIP acts as a mature teacher to generate pseudo-labels for teaching common REC models. With our careful designs, this scheme can even help existing REC models achieve better weakly supervised performance than RefCLIP, e.g., TransVG and SimREC. To validate our approaches, we conduct extensive experiments on four REC benchmarks, i.e., RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, RefCOCOg and ReferItGame. Experimental results not only report our significant performance gains over existing weakly supervised models, e.g., +24.87% on RefCOCO, but also show the 5x faster inference speed.

LOCATE: Localize and Transfer Object Parts for Weakly Supervised Affordance Grounding,"Humans excel at acquiring knowledge through observation. For example, we can learn to use new tools by watching demonstrations. This skill is fundamental for intelligent systems to interact with the world. A key step to acquire this skill is to identify what part of the object affords each action, which is called affordance grounding. In this paper, we address this problem and propose a framework called LOCATE that can identify matching object parts across images, to transfer knowledge from images where an object is being used (exocentric images used for learning), to images where the object is inactive (egocentric ones used to test). To this end, we first find interaction areas and extract their feature embeddings. Then we learn to aggregate the embeddings into compact prototypes (human, object part, and background), and select the one representing the object part. Finally, we use the selected prototype to guide affordance grounding. We do this in a weakly supervised manner, learning only from image-level affordance and object labels. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods by a large margin on both seen and unseen objects.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Li_LOCATE_Localize_and_Transfer_Object_Parts_for_Weakly_Supervised_Affordance_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Exploring the Effect of Primitives for Compositional Generalization in Vision-and-Language,"Compositionality is one of the fundamental properties of human cognition (Fodor & Pylyshyn, 1988). Compositional generalization is critical to simulate the compositional capability of humans, and has received much attention in the vision-and-language (V&L) community. It is essential to understand the effect of the primitives, including words, image regions, and video frames, to improve the compositional generalization capability. In this paper, we explore the effect of primitives for compositional generalization in V&L. Specifically, we present a self-supervised learning based framework that equips V&L methods with two characteristics: semantic equivariance and semantic invariance. With the two characteristics, the methods understand primitives by perceiving the effect of primitive changes on sample semantics and ground-truth. Experimental results on two tasks: temporal video grounding and visual question answering, demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Li_Exploring_the_Effect_of_Primitives_for_Compositional_Generalization_in_Vision-and-Language_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Affordance Grounding From Demonstration Video To Target Image,"Humans excel at learning from expert demonstrations and solving their own problems. To equip intelligent robots and assistants, such as AR glasses, with this ability, it is essential to ground human hand interactions (i.e., affordances) from demonstration videos and apply them to a target image like a user's AR glass view. The video-to-image affordance grounding task is challenging due to (1) the need to predict fine-grained affordances, and (2) the limited training data, which inadequately covers video-image discrepancies and negatively impacts grounding. To tackle them, we propose Affordance Transformer (Afformer), which has a fine-grained transformer-based decoder that gradually refines affordance grounding. Moreover, we introduce Mask Affordance Hand (MaskAHand), a self-supervised pretraining technique for synthesizing video-image data and simulating context changes, enhancing affordance grounding across video-image discrepancies. Afformer with MaskAHand pre-training achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, including a substantial 37% improvement on the OPRA dataset.

Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation,"Misinformation has become a pressing issue. Fake media, in both visual and textual forms, is widespread on the web. While various deepfake detection and text fake news detection methods have been proposed, they are only designed for single-modality forgery based on binary classification, let alone analyzing and reasoning subtle forgery traces across different modalities. In this paper, we highlight a new research problem for multi-modal fake media, namely Detecting and Grounding Multi-Modal Media Manipulation (DGM^4). DGM^4 aims to not only detect the authenticity of multi-modal media, but also ground the manipulated content (i.e., image bounding boxes and text tokens), which requires deeper reasoning of multi-modal media manipulation. To support a large-scale investigation, we construct the first DGM^4 dataset, where image-text pairs are manipulated by various approaches, with rich annotation of diverse manipulations. Moreover, we propose a novel HierArchical Multi-modal Manipulation rEasoning tRansformer (HAMMER) to fully capture the fine-grained interaction between different modalities. HAMMER performs 1) manipulation-aware contrastive learning between two uni-modal encoders as shallow manipulation reasoning, and 2) modality-aware cross-attention by multi-modal aggregator as deep manipulation reasoning. Dedicated manipulation detection and grounding heads are integrated from shallow to deep levels based on the interacted multi-modal information. Finally, we build an extensive benchmark and set up rigorous evaluation metrics for this new research problem. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model; several valuable observations are also revealed to facilitate future research in multi-modal media manipulation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Shao_Detecting_and_Grounding_Multi-Modal_Media_Manipulation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Joint Visual Grounding and Tracking With Natural Language Specification,"Tracking by natural language specification aims to locate the referred target in a sequence based on the natural language description. Existing algorithms solve this issue in two steps, visual grounding and tracking, and accordingly deploy the separated grounding model and tracking model to implement these two steps, respectively. Such a separated framework overlooks the link between visual grounding and tracking, which is that the natural language descriptions provide global semantic cues for localizing the target for both two steps. Besides, the separated framework can hardly be trained end-to-end. To handle these issues, we propose a joint visual grounding and tracking framework, which reformulates grounding and tracking as a unified task: localizing the referred target based on the given visual-language references. Specifically, we propose a multi-source relation modeling module to effectively build the relation between the visual-language references and the test image. In addition, we design a temporal modeling module to provide a temporal clue with the guidance of the global semantic information for our model, which effectively improves the adaptability to the appearance variations of the target. Extensive experimental results on TNL2K, LaSOT, OTB99, and RefCOCOg demonstrate that our method performs favorably against state-of-the-art algorithms for both tracking and grounding.

Contrastive Grouping With Transformer for Referring Image Segmentation,"Referring image segmentation aims to segment the target referent in an image conditioning on a natural language expression. Existing one-stage methods employ per-pixel classification frameworks, which attempt straightforwardly to align vision and language at the pixel level, thus failing to capture critical object-level information. In this paper, we propose a mask classification framework, Contrastive Grouping with Transformer network (CGFormer), which explicitly captures object-level information via token-based querying and grouping strategy. Specifically, CGFormer first introduces learnable query tokens to represent objects and then alternately queries linguistic features and groups visual features into the query tokens for object-aware cross-modal reasoning. In addition, CGFormer achieves cross-level interaction by jointly updating the query tokens and decoding masks in every two consecutive layers. Finally, CGFormer cooperates contrastive learning to the grouping strategy to identify the token and its mask corresponding to the referent. Experimental results demonstrate that CGFormer outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both segmentation and generalization settings consistently and significantly.

Improving Visual Grounding by Encouraging Consistent Gradient-Based Explanations,"We propose a margin-based loss for tuning joint vision-language models so that their gradient-based explanations are consistent with region-level annotations provided by humans for relatively smaller grounding datasets. We refer to this objective as Attention Mask Consistency (AMC) and demonstrate that it produces superior visual grounding results than previous methods that rely on using vision-language models to score the outputs of object detectors. Particularly, a model trained with AMC on top of standard vision-language modeling objectives obtains a state-of-the-art accuracy of 86.49% in the Flickr30k visual grounding benchmark, an absolute improvement of 5.38% when compared to the best previous model trained under the same level of supervision. Our approach also performs exceedingly well on established benchmarks for referring expression comprehension where it obtains 80.34% accuracy in the easy test of RefCOCO+, and 64.55% in the difficult split. AMC is effective, easy to implement, and is general as it can be adopted by any vision-language model, and can use any type of region annotations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yang_Improving_Visual_Grounding_by_Encouraging_Consistent_Gradient-Based_Explanations_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Text-Visual Prompting for Efficient 2D Temporal Video Grounding,"In this paper, we study the problem of temporal video grounding (TVG), which aims to predict the starting/ending time points of moments described by a text sentence within a long untrimmed video. Benefiting from fine-grained 3D visual features, the TVG techniques have achieved remarkable progress in recent years. However, the high complexity of 3D convolutional neural networks (CNNs) makes extracting dense 3D visual features time-consuming, which calls for intensive memory and computing resources. Towards efficient TVG, we propose a novel text-visual prompting (TVP) framework, which incorporates optimized perturbation patterns (that we call 'prompts') into both visual inputs and textual features of a TVG model. In sharp contrast to 3D CNNs, we show that TVP allows us to effectively co-train vision encoder and language encoder in a 2D TVG model and improves the performance of crossmodal feature fusion using only low-complexity sparse 2D visual features. Further, we propose a Temporal-Distance IoU (TDIoU) loss for efficient learning of TVG. Experiments on two benchmark datasets, Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets, empirically show that the proposed TVP significantly boosts the performance of 2D TVG (e.g., 9.79% improvement on Charades-STA and 30.77% improvement on ActivityNet Captions) and achieves 5x inference acceleration over TVG using 3D visual features.

EDA: Explicit Text-Decoupling and Dense Alignment for 3D Visual Grounding,"3D visual grounding aims to find the object within point clouds mentioned by free-form natural language descriptions with rich semantic cues. However, existing methods either extract the sentence-level features coupling all words or focus more on object names, which would lose the word-level information or neglect other attributes. To alleviate these issues, we present EDA that Explicitly Decouples the textual attributes in a sentence and conducts Dense Alignment between such fine-grained language and point cloud objects. Specifically, we first propose a text decoupling module to produce textual features for every semantic component. Then, we design two losses to supervise the dense matching between two modalities: position alignment loss and semantic alignment loss. On top of that, we further introduce a new visual grounding task, locating objects without object names, which can thoroughly evaluate the model's dense alignment capacity. Through experiments, we achieve state-of-the-art performance on two widely-adopted 3D visual grounding datasets, ScanRefer and SR3D/NR3D, and obtain absolute leadership on our newly-proposed task.

Audio-Visual Grouping Network for Sound Localization From Mixtures,"Sound source localization is a typical and challenging task that predicts the location of sound sources in a video. Previous single-source methods mainly used the audio-visual association as clues to localize sounding objects in each frame. Due to the mixed property of multiple sound sources in the original space, there exist rare multi-source approaches to localizing multiple sources simultaneously, except for one recent work using a contrastive random walk in the graph with images and separated sound as nodes. Despite their promising performance, they can only handle a fixed number of sources, and they cannot learn compact class-aware representations for individual sources. To alleviate this shortcoming, in this paper, we propose a novel audio-visual grouping network, namely AVGN, that can directly learn category-wise semantic features for each source from the input audio mixture and frame to localize multiple sources simultaneously. Specifically, our AVGN leverages learnable audio-visual class tokens to aggregate class-aware source features. Then, the aggregated semantic features for each source can be used as guidance to localize the corresponding visual regions. Compared to existing multi-source methods, our new framework can localize a flexible number of sources and disentangle category-aware audio-visual representations for individual sound sources. We conduct extensive experiments on MUSIC, VGGSound-Instruments, and VGG-Sound Sources benchmarks. The results demonstrate that the proposed AVGN can achieve state-of-the-art sounding object localization performance on both single-source and multi-source scenarios.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Mo_Audio-Visual_Grouping_Network_for_Sound_Localization_From_Mixtures_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Where Is My Wallet? Modeling Object Proposal Sets for Egocentric Visual Query Localization,"This paper deals with the problem of localizing objects in image and video datasets from visual exemplars. In particular, we focus on the challenging problem of egocentric visual query localization. We first identify grave implicit biases in current query-conditioned model design and visual query datasets. Then, we directly tackle such biases at both frame and object set levels. Concretely, our method solves these issues by expanding limited annotations and dynamically dropping object proposals during training. Additionally, we propose a novel transformer-based module that allows for object-proposal set context to be considered while incorporating query information. We name our module Conditioned Contextual Transformer or CocoFormer. Our experiments show that the proposed adaptations improve egocentric query detection, leading to a better visual query localization system in both 2D and 3D configurations. Thus, we are able to improve frame-level detection performance from 26.28% to 31.26% in AP, which correspondingly improves the VQ2D and VQ3D localization scores by significant margins. Our improved context-aware query object detector ranked first and second in the VQ2D and VQ3D tasks in the 2nd Ego4D challenge. In addition, we showcase the relevance of our proposed model in the Few-Shot Detection (FSD) task, where we also achieve SOTA results.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Xu_Where_Is_My_Wallet_Modeling_Object_Proposal_Sets_for_Egocentric_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Advancing Visual Grounding With Scene Knowledge: Benchmark and Method,"Visual grounding (VG) aims to establish fine-grained alignment between vision and language. Ideally, it can be a testbed for vision-and-language models to evaluate their understanding of the images and texts and their reasoning abilities over their joint space. However, most existing VG datasets are constructed using simple description texts, which do not require sufficient reasoning over the images and texts. This has been demonstrated in a recent study, where a simple LSTM-based text encoder without pretraining can achieve state-of-the-art performance on mainstream VG datasets. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel benchmark of Scene Knowledge-guided Visual Grounding (SK-VG), where the image content and referring expressions are not sufficient to ground the target objects, forcing the models to have a reasoning ability on the long-form scene knowledge. To perform this task, we propose two approaches to accept the triple-type input, where the former embeds knowledge into the image features before the image-query interaction; the latter leverages linguistic structure to assist in computing the image-text matching. We conduct extensive experiments to analyze the above methods and show that the proposed approaches achieve promising results but still leave room for improvement, including performance and interpretability.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Song_Advancing_Visual_Grounding_With_Scene_Knowledge_Benchmark_and_Method_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Referring Multi-Object Tracking,"Existing referring understanding tasks tend to involve the detection of a single text-referred object. In this paper, we propose a new and general referring understanding task, termed referring multi-object tracking (RMOT). Its core idea is to employ a language expression as a semantic cue to guide the prediction of multi-object tracking. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work to achieve an arbitrary number of referent object predictions in videos. To push forward RMOT, we construct one benchmark with scalable expressions based on KITTI, named Refer-KITTI. Specifically, it provides 18 videos with 818 expressions, and each expression in a video is annotated with an average of 10.7 objects. Further, we develop a transformer-based architecture TransRMOT to tackle the new task in an online manner, which achieves impressive detection performance and outperforms other counterparts. The Refer-KITTI dataset and the code are released at https://referringmot.github.io.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wu_Referring_Multi-Object_Tracking_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Weakly Supervised Temporal Sentence Grounding With Uncertainty-Guided Self-Training,"The task of weakly supervised temporal sentence grounding aims at finding the corresponding temporal moments of a language description in the video, given video-language correspondence only at video-level. Most existing works select mismatched video-language pairs as negative samples and train the model to generate better positive proposals that are distinct from the negative ones. However, due to the complex temporal structure of videos, proposals distinct from the negative ones may correspond to several video segments but not necessarily the correct ground truth. To alleviate this problem, we propose an uncertainty-guided self-training technique to provide extra self-supervision signals to guide the weakly-supervised learning. The self-training process is based on teacher-student mutual learning with weak-strong augmentation, which enables the teacher network to generate relatively more reliable outputs compared to the student network, so that the student network can learn from the teacher's output. Since directly applying existing self-training methods in this task easily causes error accumulation, we specifically design two techniques in our self-training method: (1) we construct a Bayesian teacher network, leveraging its uncertainty as a weight to suppress the noisy teacher supervisory signals; (2) we leverage the cycle consistency brought by temporal data augmentation to perform mutual learning between the two networks. Experiments demonstrate our method's superiority on Charades-STA and ActivityNet Captions datasets. We also show in the experiment that our self-training method can be applied to improve the performance of multiple backbone methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Huang_Weakly_Supervised_Temporal_Sentence_Grounding_With_Uncertainty-Guided_Self-Training_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Referring Image Matting,"Different from conventional image matting, which either requires user-defined scribbles/trimap to extract a specific foreground object or directly extracts all the foreground objects in the image indiscriminately, we introduce a new task named Referring Image Matting (RIM) in this paper, which aims to extract the meticulous alpha matte of the specific object that best matches the given natural language description, thus enabling a more natural and simpler instruction for image matting. First, we establish a large-scale challenging dataset RefMatte by designing a comprehensive image composition and expression generation engine to automatically produce high-quality images along with diverse text attributes based on public datasets. RefMatte consists of 230 object categories, 47,500 images, 118,749 expression-region entities, and 474,996 expressions. Additionally, we construct a real-world test set with 100 high-resolution natural images and manually annotate complex phrases to evaluate the out-of-domain generalization abilities of RIM methods. Furthermore, we present a novel baseline method CLIPMat for RIM, including a context-embedded prompt, a text-driven semantic pop-up, and a multi-level details extractor. Extensive experiments on RefMatte in both keyword and expression settings validate the superiority of CLIPMat over representative methods. We hope this work could provide novel insights into image matting and encourage more follow-up studies. The dataset, code and models are available at https://github.com/JizhiziLi/RIM.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Li_Referring_Image_Matting_CVPR_2023_paper.html
RefTeacher: A Strong Baseline for Semi-Supervised Referring Expression Comprehension,"Referring expression comprehension (REC) often requires a large number of instance-level annotations for fully supervised learning, which are laborious and expensive. In this paper, we present the first attempt of semi-supervised learning for REC and propose a strong baseline method called RefTeacher. Inspired by the recent progress in computer vision, RefTeacher adopts a teacher-student learning paradigm, where the teacher REC network predicts pseudo-labels for optimizing the student one. This paradigm allows REC models to exploit massive unlabeled data based on a small fraction of labeled. In particular, we also identify two key challenges in semi-supervised REC, namely, sparse supervision signals and worse pseudo-label noise. To address these issues, we equip RefTeacher with two novel designs called Attention-based Imitation Learning (AIL) and Adaptive Pseudo-label Weighting (APW). AIL can help the student network imitate the recognition behaviors of the teacher, thereby obtaining sufficient supervision signals. APW can help the model adaptively adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels with varying qualities, thus avoiding confirmation bias. To validate RefTeacher, we conduct extensive experiments on three REC benchmark datasets. Experimental results show that RefTeacher obtains obvious gains over the fully supervised methods. More importantly, using only 10% labeled data, our approach allows the model to achieve near 100% fully supervised performance, e.g., only -2.78% on RefCOCO.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Sun_RefTeacher_A_Strong_Baseline_for_Semi-Supervised_Referring_Expression_Comprehension_CVPR_2023_paper.html
3D Highlighter: Localizing Regions on 3D Shapes via Text Descriptions,"We present 3D Highlighter, a technique for localizing semantic regions on a mesh using text as input. A key feature of our system is the ability to interpret ""out-of-domain"" localizations. Our system demonstrates the ability to reason about where to place non-obviously related concepts on an input 3D shape, such as adding clothing to a bare 3D animal model. Our method contextualizes the text description using a neural field and colors the corresponding region of the shape using a probability-weighted blend. Our neural optimization is guided by a pre-trained CLIP encoder, which bypasses the need for any 3D datasets or 3D annotations. Thus, 3D Highlighter is highly flexible, general, and capable of producing localizations on a myriad of input shapes.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Decatur_3D_Highlighter_Localizing_Regions_on_3D_Shapes_via_Text_Descriptions_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Iterative Proposal Refinement for Weakly-Supervised Video Grounding,"Weakly-Supervised Video Grounding (WSVG) aims to localize events of interest in untrimmed videos with only video-level annotations. To date, most of the state-of-the-art WSVG methods follow a two-stage pipeline, i.e., firstly generating potential temporal proposals and then grounding with these proposal candidates. Despite the recent progress, existing proposal generation methods suffer from two drawbacks: 1) lack of explicit correspondence modeling; and 2) partial coverage of complex events. To this end, we propose a novel IteRative prOposal refiNement network (dubbed as IRON) to gradually distill the prior knowledge into each proposal and encourage proposals with more complete coverage. Specifically, we set up two lightweight distillation branches to uncover the cross-modal correspondence on both the semantic and conceptual levels. Then, an iterative Label Propagation (LP) strategy is devised to prevent the network from focusing excessively on the most discriminative events instead of the whole sentence content. Precisely, during each iteration, the proposal with the minimal distillation loss and its adjacent ones are regarded as the positive samples, which refines proposal confidence scores in a cascaded manner. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on two challenging WSVG datasets have attested to the effectiveness of our IRON.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Cao_Iterative_Proposal_Refinement_for_Weakly-Supervised_Video_Grounding_CVPR_2023_paper.html
GLIGEN: Open-Set Grounded Text-to-Image Generation,"Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have made amazing advances. However, the status quo is to use text input alone, which can impede controllability. In this work, we propose GLIGEN: Open-Set Grounded Text-to-Image Generation, a novel approach that builds upon and extends the functionality of existing pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models by enabling them to also be conditioned on grounding inputs. To preserve the vast concept knowledge of the pre-trained model, we freeze all of its weights and inject the grounding information into new trainable layers via a gated mechanism. Our model achieves open-world grounded text2img generation with caption and bounding box condition inputs, and the grounding ability generalizes well to novel spatial configurations and concepts. GLIGEN's zero-shot performance on COCO and LVIS outperforms existing supervised layout-to-image baselines by a large margin.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Li_GLIGEN_Open-Set_Grounded_Text-to-Image_Generation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
You Can Ground Earlier Than See: An Effective and Efficient Pipeline for Temporal Sentence Grounding in Compressed Videos,"Given an untrimmed video, temporal sentence grounding (TSG) aims to locate a target moment semantically according to a sentence query. Although previous respectable works have made decent success, they only focus on high-level visual features extracted from the consecutive decoded frames and fail to handle the compressed videos for query modelling, suffering from insufficient representation capability and significant computational complexity during training and testing. In this paper, we pose a new setting, compressed-domain TSG, which directly utilizes compressed videos rather than fully-decompressed frames as the visual input. To handle the raw video bit-stream input, we propose a novel Three-branch Compressed-domain Spatial-temporal Fusion (TCSF) framework, which extracts and aggregates three kinds of low-level visual features (I-frame, motion vector and residual features) for effective and efficient grounding. Particularly, instead of encoding the whole decoded frames like previous works, we capture the appearance representation by only learning the I-frame feature to reduce delay or latency. Besides, we explore the motion information not only by learning the motion vector feature, but also by exploring the relations of neighboring frames via the residual feature. In this way, a three-branch spatial-temporal attention layer with an adaptive motion-appearance fusion module is further designed to extract and aggregate both appearance and motion information for the final grounding. Experiments on three challenging datasets shows that our TCSF achieves better performance than other state-of-the-art methods with lower complexity.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Fang_You_Can_Ground_Earlier_Than_See_An_Effective_and_Efficient_CVPR_2023_paper.html
RefEgo: Referring Expression Comprehension Dataset from First-Person Perception of Ego4D,"Grounding textual expressions on scene objects from first-person views is a truly demanding capability in developing agents that are aware of their surroundings and behave following intuitive text instructions. Such capability is of necessity for glass-devices or autonomous robots to localize referred objects in the real-world. In the conventional referring expression comprehension tasks of images, however, datasets are mostly constructed based on the web-crawled data and don't reflect diverse real-world structures on the task of grounding textual expressions in diverse objects in the real world. Recently, a massive-scale egocentric video dataset of Ego4D was proposed. Ego4D covers around the world diverse real-world scenes including numerous indoor and outdoor situations such as shopping, cooking, walking, talking, manufacturing, etc. Based on egocentric videos of Ego4D, we constructed a broad coverage of the video-based referring expression comprehension dataset: RefEgo. Our dataset includes more than 12k video clips and 41 hours for video-based referring expression comprehension annotation.
 In experiments, we combine the state-of-the-art 2D referring expression comprehension models with the object tracking algorithm, achieving the video-wise referred object tracking even in difficult conditions: the referred object becomes out-of-frame in the middle of the video or multiple similar objects are presented in the video.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Kurita_RefEgo_Referring_Expression_Comprehension_Dataset_from_First-Person_Perception_of_Ego4D_ICCV_2023_paper.html
TextPSG: Panoptic Scene Graph Generation from Textual Descriptions,"Panoptic Scene Graph has recently been proposed for comprehensive scene understanding. However, previous works adopt a fully-supervised learning manner, requiring large amounts of pixel-wise densely-annotated data, which is always tedious and expensive to obtain. To address this limitation, we study a new problem of Panoptic Scene Graph Generation from Purely Textual Descriptions (Caption-to-PSG). The key idea is to leverage the large collection of free image-caption data on the Web alone to generate panoptic scene graphs. The problem is very challenging for three constraints: 1) no location priors; 2) no explicit links between visual regions and textual entities; and 3) no pre-defined concept sets. To tackle this problem, we propose a new framework TextPSG consisting of four modules, i.e., a region grouper, an entity grounder, a segment merger, and a label generator, with several novel techniques. The region grouper first groups image pixels into different segments and the entity grounder then aligns visual segments with language entities based on the textual description of the segment being referred to. The grounding results can thus serve as pseudo labels enabling the segment merger to learn the segment similarity as well as guiding the label generator to learn object semantics and relation predicates, resulting in a fine-grained structured scene understanding. Our framework is effective, significantly outperforming the baselines and achieving strong out-of-distribution robustness. We perform comprehensive ablation studies to corroborate the effectiveness of our design choices and provide an in-depth analysis to highlight future directions.

MeViS: A Large-scale Benchmark for Video Segmentation with Motion Expressions,"This paper strives for motion expressions guided video segmentation, which focuses on segmenting objects in video content based on a sentence describing the motion of the objects. Existing referring video object datasets typically focus on salient objects and use language expressions that contain excessive static attributes that could potentially enable the target object to be identified in a single frame. These datasets downplay the importance of motion in video content for language-guided video object segmentation. To investigate the feasibility of using motion expressions to ground and segment objects in videos, we propose a large-scale dataset called MeViS, which contains numerous motion expressions to indicate target objects in complex environments. We benchmarked 5 existing referring video object segmentation (RVOS) methods and conducted a comprehensive comparison on the MeViS dataset. The results show that current RVOS methods cannot effectively address motion expression-guided video segmentation. We further analyze the challenges and propose a baseline approach for the proposed MeViS dataset. The goal of our benchmark is to provide a platform that enables the development of effective language-guided video segmentation algorithms that leverage motion expressions as a primary cue for object segmentation in complex video scenes. The proposed MeViS dataset has been released at https://henghuiding.github.io/MeViS.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Ding_MeViS_A_Large-scale_Benchmark_for_Video_Segmentation_with_Motion_Expressions_ICCV_2023_paper.html
EgoLoc: Revisiting 3D Object Localization from Egocentric Videos with Visual Queries,"With the recent advances in video and 3D understanding, novel 4D spatio-temporal methods fusing both concepts have emerged. Towards this direction, the Ego4D Episodic Memory Benchmark proposed a task for Visual Queries with 3D Localization (VQ3D). Given an egocentric video clip and an image crop depicting a query object, the goal is to localize the 3D position of the center of that query object with respect to the camera pose of a query frame. Current methods tackle the problem of VQ3D by unprojecting the 2D localization results of the sibling task Visual Queries with 2D Localization (VQ2D) into 3D predictions. Yet, we point out that the low number of camera poses caused by camera re-localization from previous VQ3D methods severally hinders their overall success rate. In this work, we formalize a pipeline (we dub EgoLoc) that better entangles 3D multiview geometry with 2D object retrieval from egocentric videos. Our approach involves estimating more robust camera poses and aggregating multi-view 3D displacements by leveraging the 2D detection confidence, which enhances the success rate of object queries and leads to a significant improvement in the VQ3D baseline performance. Specifically, our approach achieves an overall success rate of up to 87.12%, which sets a new state-of-the-art result in the VQ3D task. We provide a comprehensive empirical analysis of the VQ3D task and existing solutions, and highlight the remaining challenges in VQ3D.

G2L: Semantically Aligned and Uniform Video Grounding via Geodesic and Game Theory,"The recent video grounding works attempt to introduce vanilla contrastive learning into video grounding. However, we claim that this naive solution is suboptimal. Contrastive learning requires two key properties: (1) alignment of features of similar samples, and (2) uniformity of the induced distribution of the normalized features on the hypersphere. Due to two annoying issues in video grounding: (1) the co-existence of some visual entities in both ground truth and other moments, i.e. semantic overlapping; (2) only a few moments in the video are annotated, i.e. sparse annotation dilemma, vanilla contrastive learning is unable to model the correlations between temporally distant moments and learned inconsistent video representations. Both characteristics lead to vanilla contrastive learning being unsuitable for video grounding. In this paper, we introduce Geodesic and Game Localization (G2L), a semantically aligned and uniform video grounding framework via geodesic and game theory. We quantify the correlations among moments leveraging the geodesic distance that guides the model to learn the correct cross-modal representations. Furthermore, from the novel perspective of game theory, we propose semantic Shapley interaction based on geodesic distance sampling to learn fine-grained semantic alignment in similar moments. Experiments on three benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Li_G2L_Semantically_Aligned_and_Uniform_Video_Grounding_via_Geodesic_and_ICCV_2023_paper.html
ViewRefer: Grasp the Multi-view Knowledge for 3D Visual Grounding,"Understanding 3D scenes from multi-view inputs has been proven to alleviate the view discrepancy issue in 3D visual grounding. However, existing methods normally neglect the view cues embedded in the text modality and fail to weigh the relative importance of different views. In this paper, we propose ViewRefer, a multi-view framework for 3D visual grounding exploring how to grasp the view knowledge from both text and 3D modalities. For the text branch, ViewRefer leverages the diverse linguistic knowledge of large-scale language models to expand a single grounding text to multiple geometry-consistent descriptions. Meanwhile, in the 3D modality, a transformer fusion module with inter-view attention is introduced to boost the interaction of objects across views. On top of that, we further present a set of learnable multi-view prototypes, which memorize scene-agnostic knowledge for different views, and enhance the framework from two perspectives: a view-guided attention module for more robust text features, and a view-guided scoring strategy during the final prediction. With our designed paradigm, ViewRefer achieves superior performance on three benchmarks and surpasses the second-best by +2.8%, +1.5%, and +1.35% on Sr3D, Nr3D, and ScanRefer.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Guo_ViewRefer_Grasp_the_Multi-view_Knowledge_for_3D_Visual_Grounding_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Temporal Collection and Distribution for Referring Video Object Segmentation,"Referring video object segmentation aims to segment a referent throughout a video sequence according to a natural language expression. It requires aligning the natural language expression with the objects' motions and their dynamic associations at the global video level but segmenting objects at the frame level. To achieve this goal, we propose to simultaneously maintain a global referent token and a sequence of object queries, where the former is responsible for capturing video-level referent according to the language expression, while the latter serves to better locate and segment objects with each frame. Furthermore, to explicitly capture object motions and spatial-temporal cross-modal reasoning over objects, we propose a novel temporal collection-distribution mechanism for interacting between the global referent token and object queries. Specifically, the temporal collection mechanism collects global information for the referent token from object queries to the temporal motions to the language expression. In turn, the temporal distribution first distributes the referent token to the referent sequence across all frames and then performs efficient cross-frame reasoning between the referent sequence and object queries in every frame. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods on all benchmarks consistently and significantly.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Tang_Temporal_Collection_and_Distribution_for_Referring_Video_Object_Segmentation_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Who Are You Referring To?

In this paper, we extend this task to resolving coreferences in long-form narrations of visual scenes. First, we introduce a new dataset with annotated coreference chains and their bounding boxes, as most existing image-text datasets only contain short sentences without coreferring expressions or labeled chains. We propose a new technique that learns to identify coreference chains using weak supervision, only from image-text pairs and a regularization using prior linguistic knowledge. Our model yields large performance gains over several strong baselines in resolving coreferences. 
 We also show that coreference resolution helps improve grounding narratives in images.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Goel_Who_Are_You_Referring_To_Coreference_Resolution_In_Image_Narrations_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Bridging Vision and Language Encoders: Parameter-Efficient Tuning for Referring Image Segmentation,"Parameter efficient tuning (PET) has received considerable attention owing to its applicability to reduce the number of parameters that need to be updated while maintaining competitive performance and providing better hardware resource savings. Although substantial progress has been made, most existing studies mainly focus on either single-modal tasks or simple classification tasks, with few works paying attention to the dense prediction tasks and the interaction between different modalities. Therefore, in this paper, we do an in-depth investigation of the efficient tuning problem on referring image segmentation. First, considering the absence of interaction between the dual encoder, we design a novel adapter named Bridger to facilitate the exchange of cross-modal information. This module also plays a role in injecting vision-specific inductive biases and task-specific information into the pre-trained model while keeping its original parameters fixed. Second, we design a lightweight decoder for referring image segmentation to make further alignment on visual and linguistic features. To perform a comprehensive assessment and promote further research, we evaluate the proposed framework on several challenging benchmarks. Experimental results illustrate the effectiveness of our approach. Updating only 1.61% to 3.38% parameters, the proposed framework gains comparable or even superior performance compared to existing full fine-tuning methods that utilize the same backbone.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Xu_Bridging_Vision_and_Language_Encoders_Parameter-Efficient_Tuning_for_Referring_Image_ICCV_2023_paper.html
FACET: Fairness in Computer Vision Evaluation Benchmark,"Computer vision models have known performance disparities across attributes such as gender and skin tone. This means during tasks such as classification and detection, model performance differs for certain classes based on the demographics of the people in the image. These disparities have been shown to exist, but until now there has not been a unified approach to measure these differences for common use-cases of computer vision models. We present a new benchmark named FACET (FAirness in Computer Vision EvaluaTion), a large, publicly available evaluation set of 32k images for some of the most common vision tasks - image classification, object detection and segmentation. For every image in FACET, we hired expert reviewers to manually annotate person-related attributes such as perceived skin tone and hair type, manually draw bounding boxes and label fine-grained person-related classes such as disk jockey or guitarist. In addition, we use FACET to benchmark state-of-the-art vision models and present a deeper understanding of potential performance disparities and challenges across sensitive demographic attributes. With the exhaustive annotations collected, we probe models using single demographics attributes as well as multiple attributes using an intersectional approach (e.g. hair color and perceived skin tone). Our results show that classification, detection, segmentation, and visual grounding models exhibit performance disparities across demographic attributes and intersections of attributes. These harms suggest that not all people represented in datasets receive fair and equitable treatment in these vision tasks. We hope current and future results using our benchmark will contribute
 to fairer, more robust vision models. FACET is available publicly at https://facet.metademolab.com",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Gustafson_FACET_Fairness_in_Computer_Vision_Evaluation_Benchmark_ICCV_2023_paper.html
DetermiNet: A Large-Scale Diagnostic Dataset for Complex Visually-Grounded Referencing using Determiners,"State-of-the-art visual grounding models can achieve high detection accuracy, but they are not designed to distinguish between all objects versus only certain objects of interest. In natural language, in order to specify a particular object or set of objects of interest, humans use determiners such as ""my"", ""either"" and ""those"". Determiners, as an important word class, are a type of schema in natural language about the reference or quantity of the noun. Existing grounded referencing datasets place much less emphasis on determiners, compared to other word classes such as nouns, verbs and adjectives. This makes it difficult to develop models that understand the full variety and complexity of object referencing. Thus, we have developed and released the DetermiNet dataset, which comprises 250,000 synthetically generated images and captions based on 25 determiners. The task is to predict bounding boxes to identify objects of interest, constrained by the semantics of the given determiner. We find that current state-of-the-art visual grounding models do not perform well on the dataset, highlighting the limitations of existing models on reference and quantification tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Lee_DetermiNet_A_Large-Scale_Diagnostic_Dataset_for_Complex_Visually-Grounded_Referencing_using_ICCV_2023_paper.html
D3G: Exploring Gaussian Prior for Temporal Sentence Grounding with Glance Annotation,"Temporal sentence grounding (TSG) aims to locate a specific moment from an untrimmed video with a given natural language query. Recently, weakly supervised methods still have a large performance gap compared to fully supervised ones, while the latter requires laborious timestamp annotations. In this study, we aim to reduce the annotation cost yet keep competitive performance for TSG task compared to fully supervised ones. To achieve this goal, we investigate a recently proposed glance-supervised temporal sentence grounding task, which requires only single frame annotation (referred to as glance annotation) for each query. Under this setup, we propose a Dynamic Gaussian prior based Grounding framework with Glance annotation (D3G), which consists of a Semantic Alignment Group Contrastive Learning module (SA-GCL) and a Dynamic Gaussian prior Adjustment module (DGA). Specifically, SA-GCL samples reliable positive moments from a 2D temporal map via jointly leveraging Gaussian prior and semantic consistency, which contributes to aligning the positive sentence-moment pairs in the joint embedding space. Moreover, to alleviate the annotation bias resulting from glance annotation and model complex queries consisting of multiple events, we propose the DGA module, which adjusts the distribution dynamically to approximate the ground truth of target moments. Extensive experiments on three challenging benchmarks verify the effectiveness of the proposed D3G. It outperforms the state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods by a large margin and narrows the performance gap compared to fully supervised methods.

Localizing Moments in Long Video Via Multimodal Guidance,"The recent introduction of the large-scale, long-form MAD and Ego4D datasets has enabled researchers to investigate the performance of current state-of-the-art methods for video grounding in the long-form setup, with interesting findings: current grounding methods alone fail at tackling this challenging task and setup due to their inability to process long video sequences. In this paper, we propose a method for improving the performance of natural language grounding in long videos by identifying and pruning out non-describable windows. We design a guided grounding framework consisting of a Guidance Model and a base grounding model. The Guidance Model emphasizes describable windows, while the base grounding model analyzes short temporal windows to determine which segments accurately match a given language query. We offer two designs for the Guidance Model: Query-Agnostic and Query-Dependent, which balance efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art models by 4.1% in MAD and 4.52% in Ego4D (NLQ), respectively. Code, data and MAD's audio features necessary to reproduce our experiments are available at: https://github.com/waybarrios/guidance-based-video-grounding.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Barrios_Localizing_Moments_in_Long_Video_Via_Multimodal_Guidance_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Spectrum-guided Multi-granularity Referring Video Object Segmentation,"Current referring video object segmentation (R-VOS) techniques extract conditional kernels from encoded (low-resolution) vision-language features to segment the decoded high-resolution features. We discovered that this causes significant feature drift, which the segmentation kernels struggle to perceive during the forward computation. This negatively affects the ability of segmentation kernels. To address the drift problem, we propose a Spectrum-guided Multi-granularity (SgMg) approach, which performs direct segmentation on the encoded features and employs visual details to further optimize the masks. In addition, we propose Spectrum-guided Cross-modal Fusion (SCF) to perform intra-frame global interactions in the spectral domain for effective multimodal representation. Finally, we extend SgMg to perform multi-object R-VOS, a new paradigm that enables simultaneous segmentation of multiple referred objects in a video. This not only makes R-VOS faster, but also more practical. Extensive experiments show that SgMg achieves state-of-the-art performance on four video benchmark datasets, outperforming the nearest competitor by 2.8% points on Ref-YouTube-VOS. Our extended SgMg enables multi-object R-VOS, runs about 3 times faster while maintaining satisfactory performance.

Inverse Compositional Learning for Weakly-supervised Relation Grounding,"Video relation grounding (VRG) is a significant and challenging problem in the domains of cross-modal learning and video understanding. In this study, we introduce a novel approach called inverse compositional learning (ICL) for weakly-supervised video relation grounding. Our approach represents relations at both the holistic and partial levels, formulating VRG as a joint optimization problem that encompasses reasoning at both levels.
 For holistic-level reasoning, we propose an inverse attention mechanism and a compositional encoder to generate compositional relevance features. Additionally, we introduce an inverse loss to evaluate and learn the relevance between visual features and relation features.
 At the partial-level reasoning, we introduce a grounding by classification scheme. By leveraging the learned holistic-level features and partial-level features, we train the entire model in an end-to-end manner.
 We conduct evaluations on two challenging datasets and demonstrate the substantial superiority of our proposed method over state-of-the-art methods. Extensive ablation studies confirm the effectiveness of our approach.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Li_Inverse_Compositional_Learning_for_Weakly-supervised_Relation_Grounding_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Weakly Supervised Referring Image Segmentation with Intra-Chunk and Inter-Chunk Consistency,"Referring image segmentation (RIS) aims to localize the object in an image referred by a natural language expression. Most previous studies learn RIS with a large-scale dataset containing segmentation labels, but they are costly. We present a weakly supervised learning method for RIS that only uses readily available image-text pairs. We first train a visual-linguistic model for image-text matching and extract a visual saliency map through Grad-CAM to identify the image regions corresponding to each word. However, we found two major problems with Grad-CAM. First, it lacks consideration of critical semantic relationships between words. We tackle this problem by modeling the relationship between words through intra-chunk and inter-chunk consistency. Second, Grad-CAM identifies only small regions of the referred object, leading to low recall. Therefore, we refine the localization maps with self-attention in Transformer and unsupervised object shape prior. On three popular benchmarks (RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, G-Ref), our method significantly outperforms recent comparable techniques. We also show that our method is applicable to various levels of supervision and obtains better performance than recent methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Lee_Weakly_Supervised_Referring_Image_Segmentation_with_Intra-Chunk_and_Inter-Chunk_Consistency_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Sentence Attention Blocks for Answer Grounding,"Answer grounding is the task of locating relevant visual evidence for the Visual Question Answering task. While a wide variety of attention methods have been introduced for this task, they suffer from the following three problems: designs that do not allow the usage of pre-trained networks and do not benefit from large data pre-training, custom designs that are not based on well-grounded previous designs, therefore limiting the learning power of the network, or complicated designs that make it challenging to re-implement or improve them. In this paper, we propose a novel architectural block, which we term Sentence Attention Block, to solve these problems. The proposed block re-calibrates channel-wise image feature-maps by explicitly modeling inter-dependencies between the image feature-maps and sentence embedding. We visually demonstrate how this block filters out irrelevant feature-maps channels based on sentence embedding. We start our design with a well-known attention method, and by making minor modifications, we improve the results to achieve state-of-the-art accuracy. The flexibility of our method makes it easy to use different pre-trained backbone networks, and its simplicity makes it easy to understand and be re-implemented. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on the TextVQA-X, VQS, VQA-X, and VizWiz-VQA-Grounding datasets. We perform multiple ablation studies to show the effectiveness of our design choices.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Khoshsirat_Sentence_Attention_Blocks_for_Answer_Grounding_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Scanning Only Once: An End-to-end Framework for Fast Temporal Grounding in Long Videos,"Video temporal grounding aims to pinpoint a video segment that matches the query description. Despite the recent advance in short-form videos (e.g., in minutes), temporal grounding in long videos (e.g., in hours) is still at its early stage. To address this challenge, a common practice is to employ a sliding window, yet can be inefficient and inflexible due to the limited number of frames within the window. In this work, we propose an end-to-end framework for fast temporal grounding, which is able to model an hours-long video with one-time network execution. Our pipeline is formulated in a coarse-to-fine manner, where we first extract context knowledge from non-overlapped video clips (i.e., anchors), and then supplement the anchors that highly response to the query with detailed content knowledge. Besides the remarkably high pipeline efficiency, another advantage of our approach is the capability of capturing long-range temporal correlation, thanks to modeling the entire video as a whole, and hence facilitates more accurate grounding. Experimental results suggest that, on the long-form video datasets MAD and Ego4d, our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts, and achieves 14.6x / 102.8x higher efficiency respectively.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Pan_Scanning_Only_Once_An_End-to-end_Framework_for_Fast_Temporal_Grounding_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Distilling Coarse-to-Fine Semantic Matching Knowledge for Weakly Supervised 3D Visual Grounding,"3D visual grounding involves finding a target object in a 3D scene that corresponds to a given sentence query. Although many approaches have been proposed and achieved impressive performance, they all require dense object-sentence pair annotations in 3D point clouds, which are both time-consuming and expensive. To address the problem that fine-grained annotated data is difficult to obtain, we propose to leverage weakly supervised annotations to learn the 3D visual grounding model, i.e., only coarse scene-sentence correspondences are used to learn object-sentence links. To accomplish this, we design a novel semantic matching model that analyzes the semantic similarity between object proposals and sentences in a coarse-to-fine manner. Specifically, we first extract object proposals and coarsely select the top-K candidates based on feature and class similarity matrices. Next, we reconstruct the masked keywords of the sentence using each candidate one by one, and the reconstructed accuracy finely reflects the semantic similarity of each candidate to the query. Additionally, we distill the coarse-to-fine semantic matching knowledge into a typical two-stage 3D visual grounding model, which reduces inference costs and improves performance by taking full advantage of the well-studied structure of the existing architectures. We conduct extensive experiments on ScanRefer, Nr3D, and Sr3D, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wang_Distilling_Coarse-to-Fine_Semantic_Matching_Knowledge_for_Weakly_Supervised_3D_Visual_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Confidence-aware Pseudo-label Learning for Weakly Supervised Visual Grounding,"Visual grounding aims at localizing the target object in image which is most related to the given free-form natural language query. As labeling the position of target object is labor-intensive, the weakly supervised methods, where only image-sentence annotations are required during model training have recently received increasing attention. Most of the existing weakly-supervised methods first generate region proposals via pre-trained object detectors and then employ either cross-modal similarity score or reconstruction loss as the criteria to select proposal from them. However, due to the cross-modal heterogeneous gap, these method often suffer from high confidence spurious association and model prone to error propagation. In this paper, we propose Confidence-aware Pseudo-label Learning (CPL) to overcome the above limitations. Specifically, we first adopt both the uni-modal and cross-modal pre-trained models and propose conditional prompt engineering to automatically generate multiple `descriptive, realistic and diverse' pseudo language queries for each region proposal, and then establish reliable cross-modal association for model training based on the uni-modal similarity score (between pseudo and real text queries). Secondly, we propose a confidence-aware pseudo label verification module which reduces the amount of noise encountered in the training process and the risk of error propagation. Experiments on five widely used datasets validate the efficacy of our proposed components and demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Liu_Confidence-aware_Pseudo-label_Learning_for_Weakly_Supervised_Visual_Grounding_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Segment Every Reference Object in Spatial and Temporal Spaces,"The reference-based object segmentation tasks, namely referring image segmentation (RIS), referring video object segmentation (RVOS), and video object segmentation (VOS), aim to segment a specific object by utilizing either
 language or annotated masks as references. Despite significant progress in each respective field, current methods are task-specifically designed and developed in different directions, which hinders the activation of multi-task capabilities for these tasks. In this work, we end the current fragmented situation and propose UniRef to unify the three reference-based object segmentation tasks with a single architecture. At the heart of our approach is the multiway-fusion for handling different task with respect to their specified references. And a unified Transformer architecture is then adopted for performing instance-level segmentation. With the unified designs, UniRef can be jointly trained on a broad range of benchmarks and can flexibly perform multiple tasks at runtime by specifying the corresponding references. We evaluate the jointly trained network on various benchmarks. Extensive experimental results indicate that our proposed UniRef achieves state-of-the-art performance on RIS and RVOS, and performs competitively on VOS with a single network.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wu_Segment_Every_Reference_Object_in_Spatial_and_Temporal_Spaces_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Referring Image Segmentation Using Text Supervision,"Existing Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) methods typically require expensive pixel-level or box-level annotations for supervision. In this paper, we observe that the referring texts used in RIS already provide sufficient information to localize the target object. Hence, we propose a novel weakly-supervised RIS framework to formulate the target localization problem as a classification process to differentiate between positive and negative text expressions. While the referring text expressions for an image are used as positive expressions, the referring text expressions from other images can be used as negative expressions for this image. Our framework has three main novelties. First, we propose a bilateral prompt method to facilitate the classification process, by harmonizing the domain discrepancy between visual and linguistic features. Second, we propose a calibration method to reduce noisy background information and improve the correctness of the response maps for target object localization. Third, we propose a positive response map selection strategy to generate high-quality pseudo-labels from the enhanced response maps, for training a segmentation network for RIS inference. For evaluation, we propose a new metric to measure localization accuracy. Experiments on four benchmarks show that our framework achieves promising performances to existing fully-supervised RIS methods while outperforming state-of-the-art weakly-supervised methods adapted from related areas. Code is available at https://github.com/fawnliu/TRIS.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Liu_Referring_Image_Segmentation_Using_Text_Supervision_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Beyond One-to-One: Rethinking the Referring Image Segmentation,"Referring image segmentation aims to segment the target object referred by a natural language expression. However, previous methods rely on the strong assumption that one sentence must describe one target in the image, which is often not the case in real-world applications. As a result, such methods fail when the expressions refer to either no objects or multiple objects. In this paper, we address this issue from two perspectives. First, we propose a Dual Multi-Modal Interaction (DMMI) Network, which contains two decoder branches and enables information flow in two directions. In the text-to-image decoder, text embedding is utilized to query the visual feature and localize the corresponding target. Meanwhile, the image-to-text decoder is implemented to reconstruct the erased entity-phrase conditioned on the visual feature. In this way, visual features are encouraged to contain the critical semantic information about target entity, which supports the accurate segmentation in the text-to-image decoder in turn. Secondly, we collect a new challenging but realistic dataset called Ref-ZOM, which includes image-text pairs under different settings. Extensive experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on different datasets, and the Ref-ZOM-trained model performs well on various types of text inputs. Codes and datasets are available at https://github.com/toggle1995/RIS-DMMI.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Hu_Beyond_One-to-One_Rethinking_the_Referring_Image_Segmentation_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Learning to Ground Instructional Articles in Videos through Narrations,"In this paper we present an approach for localizing steps of procedural activities in narrated how-to videos. To deal with the scarcity of labeled data at scale, we source the step descriptions from a language knowledge base (wikiHow) containing instructional articles for a large variety of procedural tasks. Without any form of manual supervision, our model learns to temporally ground the steps of procedural articles in how-to videos by matching three modalities: frames, narrations, and step descriptions. Specifically, our method 
 aligns steps to video by fusing information from two distinct pathways: i) direct alignment of step descriptions to frames, ii) indirect alignment obtained by composing steps-to-narrations with narrations-to-video correspondences. 
 Notably, our approach performs global temporal grounding of all steps in an article at once by exploiting order information, and is trained with step pseudo-labels which are iteratively refined and aggressively filtered.
 In order to validate our model we introduce a new benchmark -- HT-Step -- obtained by manually annotating a 124-hour subset of HowTo100M with steps sourced from wikiHow articles. Experiments on this benchmark as well as zero-shot evaluations on CrossTask demonstrate that our multi-modality alignment yields dramatic gains over several baselines and prior works. Finally, we show that our inner module for matching narration-to-video outperforms by a large margin the state of the art on the HTM-Align narration-video alignment benchmark.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Mavroudi_Learning_to_Ground_Instructional_Articles_in_Videos_through_Narrations_ICCV_2023_paper.html
UniVTG: Towards Unified Video-Language Temporal Grounding,"Video Temporal Grounding (VTG), which aims to ground target clips from videos (such as consecutive intervals or disjoint shots) according to custom language queries (e.g., sentences or words), is key for video browsing on social media. Most methods in this direction develop task-specific models that are trained with type-specific labels, such as moment retrieval (time interval) and highlight detection (worthiness curve), which limits their abilities to generalize to various VTG tasks and labels. In this paper, we propose to Unify the diverse VTG labels and tasks, dubbed UniVTG, along three directions: Firstly, we revisit a wide range of VTG labels and tasks and define a unified formulation. Based on this, we develop data annotation schemes to create scalable pseudo supervision. Secondly, we develop an effective and flexible grounding model capable of addressing each task and making full use of each label. Lastly, thanks to the unified framework, we are able to unlock temporal grounding pretraining from large-scale diverse labels and develop stronger grounding abilities e.g., zero-shot grounding. Extensive experiments on three tasks (moment retrieval, highlight detection and video summarization) across seven datasets (QVHighlights, Charades-STA, TACoS, Ego4D, YouTube Highlights, TV-Sum, and QFVS) demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of our proposed framework. The codes are available at https://github.com/showlab/UniVTG.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Lin_UniVTG_Towards_Unified_Video-Language_Temporal_Grounding_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Grounding 3D Object Affordance from 2D Interactions in Images,"Grounding 3D object affordance seeks to locate objects' ""action possibilities"" regions in the 3D space, which serves as a link between perception and operation for embodied agents. Existing studies primarily focus on connecting visual affordances with geometry structures, e.g., relying on annotations to declare interactive regions of interest on the object and establishing a mapping between the regions and affordances. However, the essence of learning object affordance is to understand how to use it, and the manner that detaches interactions is limited in generalization. Normally, humans possess the ability to perceive object affordances in the physical world through demonstration images or videos. Motivated by this, we introduce a novel task setting: grounding 3D object affordance from 2D interactions in images, which faces the challenge of anticipating affordance through interactions of different sources. To address this problem, we devise a novel Interaction-driven 3D Affordance Grounding Network (IAG), which aligns the region feature of objects from different sources and models the interactive contexts for 3D object affordance grounding. Besides, we collect a Point-Image Affordance Dataset (PIAD) to support the proposed task. Comprehensive experiments on PIAD demonstrate the reliability of the proposed task and the superiority of our method. The project is available at https://github.com/yyvhang/IAGNet.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Yang_Grounding_3D_Object_Affordance_from_2D_Interactions_in_Images_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Betrayed by Captions: Joint Caption Grounding and Generation for Open Vocabulary Instance Segmentation,"In this work, we focus on open vocabulary instance segmentation to expand a segmentation model to classify and segment instance-level novel categories. Previous approaches have relied on massive caption datasets and complex pipelines to establish one-to-one mappings between image regions and words in captions. However, such methods build noisy supervision by matching non-visible words to image regions, such as adjectives and verbs. Meanwhile, context words are also important for inferring the existence of novel objects as they show high inter-correlations with novel categories. To overcome these limitations, we devise a joint Caption Grounding and Generation (CGG) framework, which incorporates a novel grounding loss that only focuses on matching object nouns to improve learning efficiency. We also introduce a caption generation head that enables additional supervision and contextual modeling as a complementation to the grounding loss. Our analysis and results demonstrate that grounding and generation components complement each other, significantly enhancing the segmentation performance for novel classes. Experiments on the COCO dataset with two settings: Open Vocabulary Instance Segmentation (OVIS) and Open Set Panoptic Segmentation (OSPS) demonstrate the superiority of the CGG. Specifically, CGG achieves a substantial improvement of 6.8% mAP for novel classes without extra data on the OVIS task and 15% PQ improvements for novel classes on the OSPS benchmark.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wu_Betrayed_by_Captions_Joint_Caption_Grounding_and_Generation_for_Open_ICCV_2023_paper.html
LERF: Language Embedded Radiance Fields,"Humans describe the physical world using natural language to refer to specific 3D locations based on a vast range of properties: visual appearance, semantics, abstract associations, or actionable affordances. In this work we propose Language Embedded Radiance Fields (LERFs), a method for grounding language embeddings from off-the-shelf models like CLIP into NeRF, which enable these types of open-ended language queries in 3D. LERF learns a dense, multi-scale language field inside NeRF by volume rendering CLIP embeddings along training rays, supervising these embeddings across training views to provide multi-view consistency and smooth the underlying language field. After optimization, LERF can extract 3D relevancy maps for a broad range of language prompts interactively in real-time, which has potential use cases in robotics, understanding vision-language models, and interacting with 3D scenes. LERF enables pixel-aligned, zero-shot queries on the distilled 3D CLIP embeddings without relying on region proposals or masks, supporting long-tail open-vocabulary queries hierarchically across the volume.

Grounded Image Text Matching with Mismatched Relation Reasoning,"This paper introduces Grounded Image Text Matching with Mismatched Relation (GITM-MR), a novel visual-linguistic joint task that evaluates the relation understanding capabilities of transformer-based pre-trained models. GITM-MR requires a model to first determine if an expression describes an image, then localize referred objects or ground the mismatched parts of the text. We provide a benchmark for evaluating vision-language (VL) models on this task, with a focus on the challenging settings of limited training data and out-of-distribution sentence lengths. Our evaluation demonstrates that pre-trained VL models often lack data efficiency and length generalization ability. To address this, we propose the Relation-sensitive Correspondence Reasoning Network (RCRN), which incorporates relation-aware reasoning via bi-directional message propagation guided by language structure. Our RCRN can be interpreted as a modular program and delivers strong performance in terms of both length generalization and data efficiency. The code and data are available on https://github.com/SHTUPLUS/GITM-MR.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wu_Grounded_Image_Text_Matching_with_Mismatched_Relation_Reasoning_ICCV_2023_paper.html

Multi3DRefer: Grounding Text Description to Multiple 3D Objects,"We introduce the task of localizing a flexible number of objects in real-world 3D scenes using natural language descriptions. Existing 3D visual grounding tasks focus on localizing a unique object given a text description. However, such a strict setting is unnatural as localizing potentially multiple objects is a common need in real-world scenarios and robotic tasks (e.g., visual navigation and object rearrangement). To address this setting we propose Multi3DRefer, generalizing the ScanRefer dataset and task. Our dataset contains 61926 descriptions of 11609 objects, where zero, single or multiple target objects are referenced by each description. We also introduce a new evaluation metric and benchmark methods from prior work to enable further investigation of multi-modal 3D scene understanding. Furthermore, we develop a better baseline leveraging 2D features from CLIP by rendering object proposals online with contrastive learning, which outperforms the state of the art on the ScanRefer benchmark.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhang_Multi3DRefer_Grounding_Text_Description_to_Multiple_3D_Objects_ICCV_2023_paper.html
OmniLabel: A Challenging Benchmark for Language-Based Object Detection,"Language-based object detection is a promising direction towards building a natural interface to describe objects in images that goes far beyond plain category names. While recent methods show great progress in that direction, proper evaluation is lacking. With OmniLabel, we propose a novel task definition, dataset, and evaluation metric. The task subsumes standard and open-vocabulary detection as well as referring expressions. With more than 30K unique object descriptions on over 25K images, OmniLabel provides a challenge benchmark with diverse and complex object descriptions in a naturally open-vocabulary setting. Moreover, a key differentiation to existing benchmarks is that our object descriptions can refer to one, multiple or even no object, hence, providing negative examples in free-form text. The proposed evaluation handles the large label space and judges performance via a modified average precision metric, which we validate by evaluating strong language-based baselines. OmniLabel indeed provides a challenging test bed for future research on language-based detection.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Schulter_OmniLabel_A_Challenging_Benchmark_for_Language-Based_Object_Detection_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Open-vocabulary Object Segmentation with Diffusion Models,"The goal of this paper is to extract the visual-language correspondence from a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model, in the form of segmentation map, i.e., simultaneously generating images and segmentation masks for the corresponding visual entities described in the text prompt. We make the following contributions: (i) we pair the existing Stable Diffusion model with a novel grounding module, that can be trained to align the visual and textual embedding space of the diffusion model with only a small number of object categories; (ii) we establish an automatic pipeline for constructing a dataset, that consists of  image, segmentation mask, text prompt  triplets, to train the proposed grounding module; (iii) we evaluate the performance of open-vocabulary grounding on images generated from the text-to-image diffusion model and show that the module can well segment the objects of categories beyond seen ones at training time; (iv) we adopt the augmented diffusion model to build a synthetic semantic segmentation dataset, and show that, training a standard segmentation model on such dataset demonstrates competitive performance on the zero-shot segmentation (ZS3) benchmark, which opens up new opportunities for adopting the powerful diffusion model for discriminative tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Li_Open-vocabulary_Object_Segmentation_with_Diffusion_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Shatter and Gather: Learning Referring Image Segmentation with Text Supervision,"Referring image segmentation, the task of segmenting any arbitrary entities described in free-form texts, opens up a variety of vision applications.
 However, manual labeling of training data for this task is prohibitively costly, leading to lack of labeled data for training. We address this issue by a weakly supervised learning approach using text descriptions of training images as the only source of supervision. To this end, we first present a new model that discovers semantic entities in input image and then combines such entities relevant to text query to predict the mask of the referent.
 We also present a new loss function that allows the model to be trained without any further supervision. Our method was evaluated on four public benchmarks for referring image segmentation, where it clearly outperformed the existing method for the same task and recent open-vocabulary segmentation models on all the benchmarks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Kim_Shatter_and_Gather_Learning_Referring_Image_Segmentation_with_Text_Supervision_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Knowing Where to Focus: Event-aware Transformer for Video Grounding,"Recent DETR-based video grounding models have made the model directly predict moment timestamps without any hand-crafted components, such as a pre-defined proposal or non-maximum suppression, by learning moment queries.
 However, their input-agnostic moment queries inevitably overlook an intrinsic temporal structure of a video, providing limited positional information.
 In this paper, we formulate an event-aware dynamic moment query to enable the model to take the input-specific content and positional information of the video into account. To this end, we present two levels of reasoning: 1) Event reasoning that captures distinctive event units constituting a given video using a slot attention mechanism; and 2) moment reasoning that fuses the moment queries with a given sentence through a gated fusion transformer layer and learns interactions between the moment queries and video-sentence representations to predict moment timestamps.
 Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the event-aware dynamic moment queries, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches on several video grounding benchmarks.

OnlineRefer: A Simple Online Baseline for Referring Video Object Segmentation,"Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) aims at segmenting an object in a video following human instruction. Current state-of-the-art methods fall into an offline pattern, in which each clip independently interacts with text embedding for cross-modal understanding. They usually present that the offline pattern is necessary for RVOS, yet model limited temporal association within each clip. In this work, we break up the previous offline belief and propose a simple yet effective online model using explicit query propagation, named OnlineRefer. Specifically, our approach leverages target cues that gather semantic information and position prior to improve the accuracy and ease of referring predictions for the current frame. Furthermore, we generalize our online model into a semi-online framework to be compatible with video-based backbones. To show the effectiveness of our method, we evaluate it on four benchmarks, i.e., Refer-Youtube-VOS, Refer-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences, and JHMDB-Sentences. Without bells and whistles, our OnlineRefer with a Swin-L backbone achieves 63.5 J&F and 64.8 J&F on Refer-Youtube-VOS and Refer-DAVIS17, outperforming all other offline methods.

This leads to the key difficulty in RVOS, i.e., various descriptions of different ob- jects are corresponding to different temporal scales in the video, which is ignored by most existing approaches with single stride of frame sampling. To tackle this problem, we propose a concise Hybrid Temporal-scale Multimodal Learning (HTML) framework, which can effectively align lingual and visual features to discover core object semantics in the video, by learning multimodal interaction hierarchically from different temporal scales. More specifically, we introduce a novel inter-scale multimodal perception module, where the language queries dynamically interact with visual features across temporal scales. It can effectively reduce complex object confusion by passing video context among different scales. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on the widely used benchmarks, including Ref- Youtube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, A2D-Sentences and JHMDB- Sentences, where our HTML achieves state-of-the-art performance on all these datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Han_HTML_Hybrid_Temporal-scale_Multimodal_Learning_Framework_for_Referring_Video_Object_ICCV_2023_paper.html
