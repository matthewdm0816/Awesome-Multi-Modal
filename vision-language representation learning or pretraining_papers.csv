Unlearnable Clusters: Towards Label-Agnostic Unlearnable Examples,"There is a growing interest in developing unlearnable examples (UEs) against visual privacy leaks on the Internet. UEs are training samples added with invisible but unlearnable noise, which have been found can prevent unauthorized training of machine learning models. UEs typically are generated via a bilevel optimization framework with a surrogate model to remove (minimize) errors from the original samples, and then applied to protect the data against unknown target models. However, existing UE generation methods all rely on an ideal assumption called labelconsistency, where the hackers and protectors are assumed to hold the same label for a given sample. In this work, we propose and promote a more practical label-agnostic setting, where the hackers may exploit the protected data quite differently from the protectors. E.g., a m-class unlearnable dataset held by the protector may be exploited by the hacker as a n-class dataset. Existing UE generation methods are rendered ineffective in this challenging setting. To tackle this challenge, we present a novel technique called Unlearnable Clusters (UCs) to generate label-agnostic unlearnable examples with cluster-wise perturbations. Furthermore, we propose to leverage Vision-and-Language Pretrained Models (VLPMs) like CLIP as the surrogate model to improve the transferability of the crafted UCs to diverse domains. We empirically verify the effectiveness of our proposed approach under a variety of settings with different datasets, target models, and even commercial platforms Microsoft Azure and Baidu PaddlePaddle.

Distilling Vision-Language Pre-Training To Collaborate With Weakly-Supervised Temporal Action Localization,"Weakly-supervised temporal action localization (WTAL) learns to detect and classify action instances with only category labels. Most methods widely adopt the off-the-shelf Classification-Based Pre-training (CBP) to generate video features for action localization. However, the different optimization objectives between classification and localization, make temporally localized results suffer from the serious incomplete issue. To tackle this issue without additional annotations, this paper considers to distill free action knowledge from Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP), as we surprisingly observe that the localization results of vanilla VLP have an over-complete issue, which is just complementary to the CBP results. To fuse such complementarity, we propose a novel distillation-collaboration framework with two branches acting as CBP and VLP respectively. The framework is optimized through a dual-branch alternate training strategy. Specifically, during the B step, we distill the confident background pseudo-labels from the CBP branch; while during the F step, the confident foreground pseudo-labels are distilled from the VLP branch. As a result, the dual-branch complementarity is effectively fused to promote one strong alliance. Extensive experiments and ablation studies on THUMOS14 and ActivityNet1.2 reveal that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Ju_Distilling_Vision-Language_Pre-Training_To_Collaborate_With_Weakly-Supervised_Temporal_Action_Localization_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Exploring Structured Semantic Prior for Multi Label Recognition With Incomplete Labels,"Multi-label recognition (MLR) with incomplete labels is very challenging. Recent works strive to explore the image-to-label correspondence in the vision-language model, i.e., CLIP, to compensate for insufficient annotations. In spite of promising performance, they generally overlook the valuable prior about the label-to-label correspondence. In this paper, we advocate remedying the deficiency of label supervision for the MLR with incomplete labels by deriving a structured semantic prior about the label-to-label correspondence via a semantic prior prompter. We then present a novel Semantic Correspondence Prompt Network (SCPNet), which can thoroughly explore the structured semantic prior. A Prior-Enhanced Self-Supervised Learning method is further introduced to enhance the use of the prior. Comprehensive experiments and analyses on several widely used benchmark datasets show that our method significantly outperforms existing methods on all datasets, well demonstrating the effectiveness and the superiority of our method. Our code will be available at https://github.com/jameslahm/SCPNet.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Ding_Exploring_Structured_Semantic_Prior_for_Multi_Label_Recognition_With_Incomplete_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Towards All-in-One Pre-Training via Maximizing Multi-Modal Mutual Information,"To effectively exploit the potential of large-scale models, various pre-training strategies supported by massive data from different sources are proposed, including supervised pre-training, weakly-supervised pre-training, and self-supervised pre-training. It has been proved that combining multiple pre-training strategies and data from various modalities/sources can greatly boost the training of large-scale models. However, current works adopt a multi-stage pre-training system, where the complex pipeline may increase the uncertainty and instability of the pre-training. It is thus desirable that these strategies can be integrated in a single-stage manner. In this paper, we first propose a general multi-modal mutual information formula as a unified optimization target and demonstrate that all mainstream approaches are special cases of our framework. Under this unified perspective, we propose an all-in-one single-stage pre-training approach, named Maximizing Multi-modal Mutual Information Pre-training (M3I Pre-training). Our approach achieves better performance than previous pre-training methods on various vision benchmarks, including ImageNet classification, COCO object detection, LVIS long-tailed object detection, and ADE20k semantic segmentation. Notably, we successfully pre-train a billion-level parameter image backbone and achieve state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks under public data setting. Code shall be released at https://github.com/OpenGVLab/M3I-Pretraining.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Su_Towards_All-in-One_Pre-Training_via_Maximizing_Multi-Modal_Mutual_Information_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Aligning Bag of Regions for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection,"Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) learn to align vision and language representations on large-scale datasets, where each image-text pair usually contains a bag of semantic concepts. However, existing open-vocabulary object detectors only align region embeddings individually with the corresponding features extracted from the VLMs. Such a design leaves the compositional structure of semantic concepts in a scene under-exploited, although the structure may be implicitly learned by the VLMs. In this work, we propose to align the embedding of bag of regions beyond individual regions. The proposed method groups contextually interrelated regions as a bag. The embeddings of regions in a bag are treated as embeddings of words in a sentence, and they are sent to the text encoder of a VLM to obtain the bag-of-regions embedding, which is learned to be aligned to the corresponding features extracted by a frozen VLM. Applied to the commonly used Faster R-CNN, our approach surpasses the previous best results by 4.6 box AP 50 and 2.8 mask AP on novel categories of open-vocabulary COCO and LVIS benchmarks, respectively. Code and models are available at https://github.com/wusize/ovdet.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wu_Aligning_Bag_of_Regions_for_Open-Vocabulary_Object_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.html
CLIP2Scene: Towards Label-Efficient 3D Scene Understanding by CLIP,"Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) achieves promising results in 2D zero-shot and few-shot learning. Despite the impressive performance in 2D, applying CLIP to help the learning in 3D scene understanding has yet to be explored. In this paper, we make the first attempt to investigate how CLIP knowledge benefits 3D scene understanding. We propose CLIP2Scene, a simple yet effective framework that transfers CLIP knowledge from 2D image-text pre-trained models to a 3D point cloud network. We show that the pre-trained 3D network yields impressive performance on various downstream tasks, i.e., annotation-free and fine-tuning with labelled data for semantic segmentation. Specifically, built upon CLIP, we design a Semantic-driven Cross-modal Contrastive Learning framework that pre-trains a 3D network via semantic and spatial-temporal consistency regularization. For the former, we first leverage CLIP's text semantics to select the positive and negative point samples and then employ the contrastive loss to train the 3D network. In terms of the latter, we force the consistency between the temporally coherent point cloud features and their corresponding image features. We conduct experiments on SemanticKITTI, nuScenes, and ScanNet. For the first time, our pre-trained network achieves annotation-free 3D semantic segmentation with 20.8% and 25.08% mIoU on nuScenes and ScanNet, respectively. When fine-tuned with 1% or 100% labelled data, our method significantly outperforms other self-supervised methods, with improvements of 8% and 1% mIoU, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability for handling cross-domain datasets.

Prefix Conditioning Unifies Language and Label Supervision,"Pretraining visual models on web-scale image-caption datasets has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional pretraining on image classification data. Image-caption datasets are more ""open-domain"", containing broader scene types and vocabulary words, and result in models that have strong performance in few- and zero-shot recognition tasks. However large-scale classification datasets can provide fine-grained categories with a balanced label distribution. In this work, we study a pretraining strategy that uses both classification and caption datasets to unite their complementary benefits. First, we show that naively unifying the datasets results in sub-optimal performance in downstream zero-shot recognition tasks, as the model is affected by dataset bias: the coverage of image domains and vocabulary words is different in each dataset. We address this problem with novel Prefix Conditioning, a simple yet effective method that helps disentangle dataset biases from visual concepts. This is done by introducing prefix tokens that inform the language encoder of the input data type (e.g., classification vs caption) at training time. Our approach allows the language encoder to learn from both datasets while also tailoring feature extraction to each dataset. Prefix conditioning is generic and can be easily integrated into existing VL pretraining objectives, such as CLIP or UniCL. In experiments, we show that it improves zero-shot image recognition and robustness to image-level distribution shift.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Saito_Prefix_Conditioning_Unifies_Language_and_Label_Supervision_CVPR_2023_paper.html
CVT-SLR: Contrastive Visual-Textual Transformation for Sign Language Recognition With Variational Alignment,"Sign language recognition (SLR) is a weakly supervised task that annotates sign videos as textual glosses. Recent studies show that insufficient training caused by the lack of large-scale available sign datasets becomes the main bottleneck for SLR. Most SLR works thereby adopt pretrained visual modules and develop two mainstream solutions. The multi-stream architectures extend multi-cue visual features, yielding the current SOTA performances but requiring complex designs and might introduce potential noise. Alternatively, the advanced single-cue SLR frameworks using explicit cross-modal alignment between visual and textual modalities are simple and effective, potentially competitive with the multi-cue framework. In this work, we propose a novel contrastive visual-textual transformation for SLR, CVT-SLR, to fully explore the pretrained knowledge of both the visual and language modalities. Based on the single-cue cross-modal alignment framework, we propose a variational autoencoder (VAE) for pretrained contextual knowledge while introducing the complete pretrained language module. The VAE implicitly aligns visual and textual modalities while benefiting from pretrained contextual knowledge as the traditional contextual module. Meanwhile, a contrastive cross-modal alignment algorithm is designed to explicitly enhance the consistency constraints. Extensive experiments on public datasets (PHOENIX-2014 and PHOENIX-2014T) demonstrate that our proposed CVT-SLR consistently outperforms existing single-cue methods and even outperforms SOTA multi-cue methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zheng_CVT-SLR_Contrastive_Visual-Textual_Transformation_for_Sign_Language_Recognition_With_Variational_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Seeing What You Miss: Vision-Language Pre-Training With Semantic Completion Learning,"Cross-modal alignment is essential for vision-language pre-training (VLP) models to learn the correct corresponding information across different modalities. For this purpose, inspired by the success of masked language modeling (MLM) tasks in the NLP pre-training area, numerous masked modeling tasks have been proposed for VLP to further promote cross-modal interactions. The core idea of previous masked modeling tasks is to focus on reconstructing the masked tokens based on visible context for learning local-to-local alignment. However, most of them pay little attention to the global semantic features generated for the masked data, resulting in a limited cross-modal alignment ability of global representations. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a novel Semantic Completion Learning (SCL) task, complementary to existing masked modeling tasks, to facilitate global-to-local alignment. Specifically, the SCL task complements the missing semantics of masked data by capturing the corresponding information from the other modality, promoting learning more representative global features which have a great impact on the performance of downstream tasks. Moreover, we present a flexible vision encoder, which enables our model to perform image-text and video-text multimodal tasks simultaneously. Experimental results show that our proposed method obtains state-of-the-art performance on various vision-language benchmarks, such as visual question answering, image-text retrieval, and video-text retrieval.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Ji_Seeing_What_You_Miss_Vision-Language_Pre-Training_With_Semantic_Completion_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Understanding and Constructing Latent Modality Structures in Multi-Modal Representation Learning,"Contrastive loss has been increasingly used in learning representations from multiple modalities. In the limit, the nature of the contrastive loss encourages modalities to exactly match each other in the latent space. Yet it remains an open question how the modality alignment affects the downstream task performance. In this paper, based on an information-theoretic argument, we first prove that exact modality alignment is sub-optimal in general for downstream prediction tasks. Hence we advocate that the key of better performance lies in meaningful latent modality structures instead of perfect modality alignment. To this end, we propose three general approaches to construct latent modality structures. Specifically, we design 1) a deep feature separation loss for intra-modality regularization; 2) a Brownian-bridge loss for inter-modality regularization; and 3) a geometric consistency loss for both intra- and inter-modality regularization. Extensive experiments are conducted on two popular multi-modal representation learning frameworks: the CLIP-based two-tower model and the ALBEF-based fusion model. We test our model on a variety of tasks including zero/few-shot image classification, image-text retrieval, visual question answering, visual reasoning, and visual entailment. Our method achieves consistent improvements over existing methods, demonstrating the effectiveness and generalizability of our proposed approach on latent modality structure regularization.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Jiang_Understanding_and_Constructing_Latent_Modality_Structures_in_Multi-Modal_Representation_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Accelerating Vision-Language Pretraining With Free Language Modeling,"The state of the arts in vision-language pretraining (VLP) achieves exemplary performance but suffers from high training costs resulting from slow convergence and long training time, especially on large-scale web datasets. An essential obstacle to training efficiency lies in the entangled prediction rate (percentage of tokens for reconstruction) and corruption rate (percentage of corrupted tokens) in masked language modeling (MLM), that is, a proper corruption rate is achieved at the cost of a large portion of output tokens being excluded from prediction loss. To accelerate the convergence of VLP, we propose a new pretraining task, namely, free language modeling (FLM), that enables a 100% prediction rate with arbitrary corruption rates. FLM successfully frees the prediction rate from the tie-up with the corruption rate while allowing the corruption spans to be customized for each token to be predicted. FLM-trained models are encouraged to learn better and faster given the same GPU time by exploiting bidirectional contexts more flexibly. Extensive experiments show FLM could achieve an impressive 2.5x pretraining time reduction in comparison to the MLM-based methods, while keeping competitive performance on both vision-language understanding and generation tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wang_Accelerating_Vision-Language_Pretraining_With_Free_Language_Modeling_CVPR_2023_paper.html
GeoLayoutLM: Geometric Pre-Training for Visual Information Extraction,"Visual information extraction (VIE) plays an important role in Document Intelligence. Generally, it is divided into two tasks: semantic entity recognition (SER) and relation extraction (RE). Recently, pre-trained models for documents have achieved substantial progress in VIE, particularly in SER. However, most of the existing models learn the geometric representation in an implicit way, which has been found insufficient for the RE task since geometric information is especially crucial for RE. Moreover, we reveal another factor that limits the performance of RE lies in the objective gap between the pre-training phase and the fine-tuning phase for RE. To tackle these issues, we propose in this paper a multi-modal framework, named GeoLayoutLM, for VIE. GeoLayoutLM explicitly models the geometric relations in pre-training, which we call geometric pre-training. Geometric pre-training is achieved by three specially designed geometry-related pre-training tasks. Additionally, novel relation heads, which are pre-trained by the geometric pre-training tasks and fine-tuned for RE, are elaborately designed to enrich and enhance the feature representation. According to extensive experiments on standard VIE benchmarks, GeoLayoutLM achieves highly competitive scores in the SER task and significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-arts for RE (e.g.,the F1 score of RE on FUNSD is boosted from 80.35% to 89.45%).",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Luo_GeoLayoutLM_Geometric_Pre-Training_for_Visual_Information_Extraction_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Open-Category Human-Object Interaction Pre-Training via Language Modeling Framework,"Human-object interaction (HOI) has long been plagued by the conflict between limited supervised data and a vast number of possible interaction combinations in real life. Current methods trained from closed-set data predict HOIs as fixed-dimension logits, which restricts their scalability to open-set categories. To address this issue, we introduce OpenCat, a language modeling framework that reformulates HOI prediction as sequence generation. By converting HOI triplets into a token sequence through a serialization scheme, our model is able to exploit the open-set vocabulary of the language modeling framework to predict novel interaction classes with a high degree of freedom. In addition, inspired by the great success of vision-language pre-training, we collect a large amount of weakly-supervised data related to HOI from image-caption pairs, and devise several auxiliary proxy tasks, including soft relational matching and human-object relation prediction, to pre-train our model. Extensive experiments show that our OpenCat significantly boosts HOI performance, particularly on a broad range of rare and unseen categories.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zheng_Open-Category_Human-Object_Interaction_Pre-Training_via_Language_Modeling_Framework_CVPR_2023_paper.html
RA-CLIP: Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training,"Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) is attracting increasing attention for its impressive zero-shot recognition performance on different down-stream tasks. However, training CLIP is data-hungry and requires lots of image-text pairs to memorize various semantic concepts. In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient framework: Retrieval Augmented Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (RA-CLIP) to augment embeddings by online retrieval. Specifically, we sample part of image-text data as a hold-out reference set. Given an input image, relevant image-text pairs are retrieved from the reference set to enrich the representation of input image. This process can be considered as an open-book exam: with the reference set as a cheat sheet, the proposed method doesn't need to memorize all visual concepts in the training data. It explores how to recognize visual concepts by exploiting correspondence between images and texts in the cheat sheet. The proposed RA-CLIP implements this idea and comprehensive experiments are conducted to show how RA-CLIP works. Performances on 10 image classification datasets and 2 object detection datasets show that RA-CLIP outperforms vanilla CLIP baseline by a large margin on zero-shot image classification task (+12.7%), linear probe image classification task (+6.9%) and zero-shot ROI classification task (+2.8%).",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Xie_RA-CLIP_Retrieval_Augmented_Contrastive_Language-Image_Pre-Training_CVPR_2023_paper.html
ERNIE-ViLG 2.0: Improving Text-to-Image Diffusion Model With Knowledge-Enhanced Mixture-of-Denoising-Experts,"Recent progress in diffusion models has revolutionized the popular technology of text-to-image generation. While existing approaches could produce photorealistic high-resolution images with text conditions, there are still several open problems to be solved, which limits the further improvement of image fidelity and text relevancy. In this paper, we propose ERNIE-ViLG 2.0, a large-scale Chinese text-to-image diffusion model, to progressively upgrade the quality of generated images by: (1) incorporating fine-grained textual and visual knowledge of key elements in the scene, and (2) utilizing different denoising experts at different denoising stages. With the proposed mechanisms, ERNIE-ViLG 2.0 not only achieves a new state-of-the-art on MS-COCO with zero-shot FID-30k score of 6.75, but also significantly outperforms recent models in terms of image fidelity and image-text alignment, with side-by-side human evaluation on the bilingual prompt set ViLG-300.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Feng_ERNIE-ViLG_2.0_Improving_Text-to-Image_Diffusion_Model_With_Knowledge-Enhanced_Mixture-of-Denoising-Experts_CVPR_2023_paper.html
A Simple Framework for Text-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Text-supervised semantic segmentation is a novel research topic that allows semantic segments to emerge with image-text contrasting. However, pioneering methods could be subject to specifically designed network architectures. This paper shows that a vanilla contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) model is an effective text-supervised semantic segmentor by itself. First, we reveal that a vanilla CLIP is inferior to localization and segmentation due to its optimization being driven by densely aligning visual and language representations. Second, we propose the locality-driven alignment (LoDA) to address the problem, where CLIP optimization is driven by sparsely aligning local representations. Third, we propose a simple segmentation (SimSeg) framework. LoDA and SimSeg jointly ameliorate a vanilla CLIP to produce impressive semantic segmentation results. Our method outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context and COCO datasets by large margins.

Weakly Supervised Video Representation Learning With Unaligned Text for Sequential Videos,"Sequential video understanding, as an emerging video understanding task, has driven lots of researchers' attention because of its goal-oriented nature. This paper studies weakly supervised sequential video understanding where the accurate time-stamp level text-video alignment is not provided. We solve this task by borrowing ideas from CLIP. Specifically, we use a transformer to aggregate frame-level features for video representation and use a pre-trained text encoder to encode the texts corresponding to each action and the whole video, respectively. To model the correspondence between text and video, we propose a multiple granularity loss, where the video-paragraph contrastive loss enforces matching between the whole video and the complete script, and a fine-grained frame-sentence contrastive loss enforces the matching between each action and its description. As the frame-sentence correspondence is not available, we propose to use the fact that video actions happen sequentially in the temporal domain to generate pseudo frame-sentence correspondence and supervise the network training with the pseudo labels. Extensive experiments on video sequence verification and text-to-video matching show that our method outperforms baselines by a large margin, which validates the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Open-Vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation With Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"We present ODISE: Open-vocabulary DIffusion-based panoptic SEgmentation, which unifies pre-trained text-image diffusion and discriminative models to perform open-vocabulary panoptic segmentation. Text-to-image diffusion models have the remarkable ability to generate high-quality images with diverse open-vocabulary language descriptions. This demonstrates that their internal representation space is highly correlated with open concepts in the real world. Text-image discriminative models like CLIP, on the other hand, are good at classifying images into open-vocabulary labels. We leverage the frozen internal representations of both these models to perform panoptic segmentation of any category in the wild. Our approach outperforms the previous state of the art by significant margins on both open-vocabulary panoptic and semantic segmentation tasks. In particular, with COCO training only, our method achieves 23.4 PQ and 30.0 mIoU on the ADE20K dataset, with 8.3 PQ and 7.9 mIoU absolute improvement over the previous state of the art.

Learning Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation Models From Natural Language Supervision,"In this paper, we consider the problem of open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS), which aims to segment objects of arbitrary classes instead of pre-defined, closed-set categories. The main contributions are as follows: First, we propose a transformer-based model for OVS, termed as OVSegmentor, which only exploits web-crawled image-text pairs for pre-training without using any mask annotations. OVSegmentor assembles the image pixels into a set of learnable group tokens via a slot-attention based binding module, and aligns the group tokens to the corresponding caption embedding. Second, we propose two proxy tasks for training, namely masked entity completion and cross-image mask consistency. The former aims to infer all masked entities in the caption given the group tokens, that enables the model to learn fine-grained alignment between visual groups and text entities. The latter enforces consistent mask predictions between images that contain shared entities, which encourages the model to learn visual invariance. Third, we construct CC4M dataset for pre-training by filtering CC12M with frequently appeared entities, which significantly improves training efficiency. Fourth, we perform zero-shot transfer on three benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO Object. Our model achieves superior segmentation results over the state-of-the-art method by using only 3% data (4M vs 134M) for pre-training. Code and pre-trained models will be released for future research.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Xu_Learning_Open-Vocabulary_Semantic_Segmentation_Models_From_Natural_Language_Supervision_CVPR_2023_paper.html
IFSeg: Image-Free Semantic Segmentation via Vision-Language Model,"Vision-language (VL) pre-training has recently gained much attention for its transferability and flexibility in novel concepts (e.g., cross-modality transfer) across various visual tasks. However, VL-driven segmentation has been under-explored, and the existing approaches still have the burden of acquiring additional training images or even segmentation annotations to adapt a VL model to downstream segmentation tasks. In this paper, we introduce a novel image-free segmentation task where the goal is to perform semantic segmentation given only a set of the target semantic categories, but without any task-specific images and annotations. To tackle this challenging task, our proposed method, coined IFSeg, generates VL-driven artificial image-segmentation pairs and updates a pre-trained VL model to a segmentation task. We construct this artificial training data by creating a 2D map of random semantic categories and another map of their corresponding word tokens. Given that a pre-trained VL model projects visual and text tokens into a common space where tokens that share the semantics are located closely, this artificially generated word map can replace the real image inputs for such a VL model. Through an extensive set of experiments, our model not only establishes an effective baseline for this novel task but also demonstrates strong performances compared to existing methods that rely on stronger supervision, such as task-specific images and segmentation masks.

Is BERT Blind? Exploring the Effect of Vision-and-Language Pretraining on Visual Language Understanding,"Most humans use visual imagination to understand and reason about language, but models such as BERT reason about language using knowledge acquired during text-only pretraining. In this work, we investigate whether vision-and-language pretraining can improve performance on text-only tasks that involve implicit visual reasoning, focusing primarily on zero-shot probing methods. We propose a suite of visual language understanding (VLU) tasks for probing the visual reasoning abilities of text encoder models, as well as various non-visual natural language understanding (NLU) tasks for comparison. We also contribute a novel zero-shot knowledge probing method, Stroop probing, for applying models such as CLIP to text-only tasks without needing a prediction head such as the masked language modelling head of models like BERT. We show that SOTA multimodally trained text encoders outperform unimodally trained text encoders on the VLU tasks while being underperformed by them on the NLU tasks, lending new context to previously mixed results regarding the NLU capabilities of multimodal models. We conclude that exposure to images during pretraining affords inherent visual reasoning knowledge that is reflected in language-only tasks that require implicit visual reasoning. Our findings bear importance in the broader context of multimodal learning, providing principled guidelines for the choice of text encoders used in such contexts.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Alper_Is_BERT_Blind_Exploring_the_Effect_of_Vision-and-Language_Pretraining_on_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Reproducible Scaling Laws for Contrastive Language-Image Learning,"Scaling up neural networks has led to remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks. Moreover, performance often follows reliable scaling laws as a function of training set size, model size, and compute, which offers valuable guidance as large-scale experiments are becoming increasingly expensive. However, previous work on scaling laws has primarily used private data & models or focused on uni-modal language or vision learning. To address these limitations, we investigate scaling laws for contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) with the public LAION dataset and the open-source OpenCLIP repository. Our large-scale experiments involve models trained on up to two billion image-text pairs and identify power law scaling for multiple downstream tasks including zero-shot classification, retrieval, linear probing, and end-to-end fine-tuning. We find that the training distribution plays a key role in scaling laws as the OpenAI and OpenCLIP models exhibit different scaling behavior despite identical model architectures and similar training recipes. We open-source our evaluation workflow and all models, including the largest public CLIP models, to ensure reproducibility and make scaling laws research more accessible.

Learning Customized Visual Models With Retrieval-Augmented Knowledge,"Image-text contrastive learning models such as CLIP have demonstrated strong task transfer ability. The high generality and usability of these visual models is achieved via a web-scale data collection process to ensure broad concept coverage, followed by expensive pre-training to feed all the knowledge into model weights. Alternatively, we propose REACT, REtrieval-Augmented CusTomization, a framework to acquire the relevant web knowledge to build customized visual models for target domains. We retrieve the most relevant image-text pairs ( 3% of CLIP pre-training data) from the web-scale database as external knowledge and propose to customize the model by only training new modularized blocks while freezing all the original weights. The effectiveness of REACT is demonstrated via extensive experiments on classification, retrieval, detection and segmentation tasks, including zero, few, and full-shot settings. Particularly, on the zero-shot classification task, compared with CLIP, it achieves up to 5.4% improvement on ImageNet and 3.7% on the ELEVATER benchmark (20 datasets).",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Liu_Learning_Customized_Visual_Models_With_Retrieval-Augmented_Knowledge_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Best of Both Worlds: Multimodal Contrastive Learning With Tabular and Imaging Data,"Medical datasets and especially biobanks, often contain extensive tabular data with rich clinical information in addition to images. In practice, clinicians typically have less data, both in terms of diversity and scale, but still wish to deploy deep learning solutions. Combined with increasing medical dataset sizes and expensive annotation costs, the necessity for unsupervised methods that can pretrain multimodally and predict unimodally has risen. To address these needs, we propose the first self-supervised contrastive learning framework that takes advantage of images and tabular data to train unimodal encoders. Our solution combines SimCLR and SCARF, two leading contrastive learning strategies, and is simple and effective. In our experiments, we demonstrate the strength of our framework by predicting risks of myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease (CAD) using cardiac MR images and 120 clinical features from 40,000 UK Biobank subjects. Furthermore, we show the generalizability of our approach to natural images using the DVM car advertisement dataset. We take advantage of the high interpretability of tabular data and through attribution and ablation experiments find that morphometric tabular features, describing size and shape, have outsized importance during the contrastive learning process and improve the quality of the learned embeddings. Finally, we introduce a novel form of supervised contrastive learning, label as a feature (LaaF), by appending the ground truth label as a tabular feature during multimodal pretraining, outperforming all supervised contrastive baselines.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Hager_Best_of_Both_Worlds_Multimodal_Contrastive_Learning_With_Tabular_and_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning Procedure-Aware Video Representation From Instructional Videos and Their Narrations,"The abundance of instructional videos and their narrations over the Internet offers an exciting avenue for understanding procedural activities. In this work, we propose to learn video representation that encodes both action steps and their temporal ordering, based on a large-scale dataset of web instructional videos and their narrations, without using human annotations. Our method jointly learns a video representation to encode individual step concepts, and a deep probabilistic model to capture both temporal dependencies and immense individual variations in the step ordering. We empirically demonstrate that learning temporal ordering not only enables new capabilities for procedure reasoning, but also reinforces the recognition of individual steps. Our model significantly advances the state-of-the-art results on step classification (+2.8% / +3.3% on COIN / EPIC-Kitchens) and step forecasting (+7.4% on COIN). Moreover, our model attains promising results in zero-shot inference for step classification and forecasting, as well as in predicting diverse and plausible steps for incomplete procedures.

CLIP the Gap: A Single Domain Generalization Approach for Object Detection,"Single Domain Generalization (SDG) tackles the problem of training a model on a single source domain so that it generalizes to any unseen target domain. While this has been well studied for image classification, the literature on SDG object detection remains almost non-existent. To address the challenges of simultaneously learning robust object localization and representation, we propose to leverage a pre-trained vision-language model to introduce semantic domain concepts via textual prompts. We achieve this via a semantic augmentation strategy acting on the features extracted by the detector backbone, as well as a text-based classification loss. Our experiments evidence the benefits of our approach, outperforming by 10% the only existing SDG object detection method, Single-DGOD[49], on their own diverse weather-driving benchmark.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Vidit_CLIP_the_Gap_A_Single_Domain_Generalization_Approach_for_Object_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Position-Guided Text Prompt for Vision-Language Pre-Training,"Vision-Language Pre-Training (VLP) has shown promising capabilities to align image and text pairs, facilitating a broad variety of cross-modal learning tasks. However, we observe that VLP models often lack the visual grounding/localization capability which is critical for many downstream tasks such as visual reasoning. In this work, we propose a novel Position-guided Text Prompt (PTP) paradigm to enhance the visual grounding ability of cross-modal models trained with VLP. Specifically, in the VLP phase, PTP divides the image into NxN blocks, and identifies the objects in each block through the widely used object detector in VLP. It then reformulates the visual grounding task into a fill-in-the-blank problem given a PTP by encouraging the model to predict the objects in the given blocks or regress the blocks of a given object, e.g. filling ""P"" or ""O"" in a PTP ""The block P has a O"". This mechanism improves the visual grounding capability of VLP models and thus helps them better handle various downstream tasks. By introducing PTP into several state-of-the-art VLP frameworks, we observe consistently significant improvements across representative cross-modal learning model architectures and several benchmarks, e.g. zero-shot Flickr30K Retrieval (+4.8 in average recall@1) for ViLT baseline, and COCO Captioning (+5.3 in CIDEr) for SOTA BLIP baseline. Moreover, PTP achieves comparable results with object-detector based methods, and much faster inference speed since PTP discards its object detector for inference while the later cannot. Our code and pre-trained weight will be released.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wang_Position-Guided_Text_Prompt_for_Vision-Language_Pre-Training_CVPR_2023_paper.html
An Empirical Study of End-to-End Video-Language Transformers With Masked Visual Modeling,"Masked visual modeling (MVM) has been recently proven effective for visual pre-training. While similar reconstructive objectives on video inputs (e.g., masked frame modeling) have been explored in video-language (VidL) pre-training, previous studies fail to find a truly effective MVM strategy that can largely benefit the downstream performance. In this work, we systematically examine the potential of MVM in the context of VidL learning. Specifically, we base our study on a fully end-to-end VIdeO-LanguagE Transformer (VIOLET), where the supervision from MVM training can be backpropagated to the video pixel space. In total, eight different reconstructive targets of MVM are explored, from low-level pixel values and oriented gradients to high-level depth maps, optical flow, discrete visual tokens, and latent visual features. We conduct comprehensive experiments and provide insights into the factors leading to effective MVM training, resulting in an enhanced model VIOLETv2. Empirically, we show VIOLETv2 pre-trained with MVM objective achieves notable improvements on 13 VidL benchmarks, ranging from video question answering, video captioning, to text-to-video retrieval.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Fu_An_Empirical_Study_of_End-to-End_Video-Language_Transformers_With_Masked_Visual_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Revisiting Temporal Modeling for CLIP-Based Image-to-Video Knowledge Transferring,"Image-text pretrained models, e.g., CLIP, have shown impressive general multi-modal knowledge learned from large-scale image-text data pairs, thus attracting increasing attention for their potential to improve visual representation learning in the video domain. In this paper, based on the CLIP model, we revisit temporal modeling in the context of image-to-video knowledge transferring, which is the key point for extending image-text pretrained models to the video domain. We find that current temporal modeling mechanisms are tailored to either high-level semantic-dominant tasks (e.g., retrieval) or low-level visual pattern-dominant tasks (e.g., recognition), and fail to work on the two cases simultaneously. The key difficulty lies in modeling temporal dependency while taking advantage of both high-level and low-level knowledge in CLIP model. To tackle this problem, we present Spatial-Temporal Auxiliary Network (STAN) -- a simple and effective temporal modeling mechanism extending CLIP model to diverse video tasks. Specifically, to realize both low-level and high-level knowledge transferring, STAN adopts a branch structure with decomposed spatial-temporal modules that enable multi-level CLIP features to be spatial-temporally contextualized. We evaluate our method on two representative video tasks: Video-Text Retrieval and Video Recognition. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our model over the state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, including MSR-VTT, DiDeMo, LSMDC, MSVD, Kinetics-400, and Something-Something-V2.

DisCo-CLIP: A Distributed Contrastive Loss for Memory Efficient CLIP Training,"We propose DisCo-CLIP, a distributed memory-efficient CLIP training approach, to reduce the memory consumption of contrastive loss when training contrastive learning models. Our approach decomposes the contrastive loss and its gradient computation into two parts, one to calculate the intra-GPU gradients and the other to compute the inter-GPU gradients. According to our decomposition, only the intra-GPU gradients are computed on the current GPU, while the inter-GPU gradients are collected via all_reduce from other GPUs instead of being repeatedly computed on every GPU. In this way, we can reduce the GPU memory consumption of contrastive loss computation from O(B^2) to O(B^2 / N), where B and N are the batch size and the number of GPUs used for training. Such a distributed solution is mathematically equivalent to the original non-distributed contrastive loss computation, without sacrificing any computation accuracy. It is particularly efficient for large-batch CLIP training. For instance, DisCo-CLIP can enable contrastive training of a ViT-B/32 model with a batch size of 32K or 196K using 8 or 64 A100 40GB GPUs, compared with the original CLIP solution which requires 128 A100 40GB GPUs to train a ViT-B/32 model with a batch size of 32K.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Chen_DisCo-CLIP_A_Distributed_Contrastive_Loss_for_Memory_Efficient_CLIP_Training_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Uni-Perceiver v2: A Generalist Model for Large-Scale Vision and Vision-Language Tasks,"Despite the remarkable success of foundation models, their task-specific fine-tuning paradigm makes them inconsistent with the goal of general perception modeling. The key to eliminating this inconsistency is to use generalist models for general task modeling. However, existing attempts at generalist models are inadequate in both versatility and performance. In this paper, we propose Uni-Perceiver v2, which is the first generalist model capable of handling major large-scale vision and vision-language tasks with competitive performance. Specifically, images are encoded as general region proposals, while texts are encoded via a Transformer-based language model. The encoded representations are transformed by a task-agnostic decoder. Different tasks are formulated as a unified maximum likelihood estimation problem. We further propose an effective optimization technique named Task-Balanced Gradient Normalization to ensure stable multi-task learning with an unmixed sampling strategy, which is helpful for tasks requiring large batch-size training. After being jointly trained on various tasks, Uni-Perceiver v2 is capable of directly handling downstream tasks without any task-specific adaptation. Results show that Uni-Perceiver v2 outperforms all existing generalist models in both versatility and performance. Meanwhile, compared with the commonly-recognized strong baselines that require tasks-specific fine-tuning, Uni-Perceiver v2 achieves competitive performance on a broad range of vision and vision-language tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Li_Uni-Perceiver_v2_A_Generalist_Model_for_Large-Scale_Vision_and_Vision-Language_CVPR_2023_paper.html
AttriCLIP: A Non-Incremental Learner for Incremental Knowledge Learning,"Continual learning aims to enable a model to incrementally learn knowledge from sequentially arrived data. Previous works adopt the conventional classification architecture, which consists of a feature extractor and a classifier. The feature extractor is shared across sequentially arrived tasks or classes, but one specific group of weights of the classifier corresponding to one new class should be incrementally expanded. Consequently, the parameters of a continual learner gradually increase. Moreover, as the classifier contains all historical arrived classes, a certain size of the memory is usually required to store rehearsal data to mitigate classifier bias and catastrophic forgetting. In this paper, we propose a non-incremental learner, named AttriCLIP, to incrementally extract knowledge of new classes or tasks. Specifically, AttriCLIP is built upon the pre-trained visual-language model CLIP. Its image encoder and text encoder are fixed to extract features from both images and text prompts. Each text prompt consists of a category name and a fixed number of learnable parameters which are selected from our designed attribute bank and serve as attributes. As we compute the visual and textual similarity for classification, AttriCLIP is a non-incremental learner. The attribute prompts, which encode the common knowledge useful for classification, can effectively mitigate the catastrophic forgetting and avoid constructing a replay memory. We empirically evaluate our AttriCLIP and compare it with CLIP-based and previous state-of-the-art continual learning methods in realistic settings with domain-shift and long-sequence learning. The results show that our method performs favorably against previous state-of-the-arts.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wang_AttriCLIP_A_Non-Incremental_Learner_for_Incremental_Knowledge_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning Instance-Level Representation for Large-Scale Multi-Modal Pretraining in E-Commerce,"This paper aims to establish a generic multi-modal foundation model that has the scalable capability to massive downstream applications in E-commerce. Recently, large-scale vision-language pretraining approaches have achieved remarkable advances in the general domain. However, due to the significant differences between natural and product images, directly applying these frameworks for modeling image-level representations to E-commerce will be inevitably sub-optimal. To this end, we propose an instance-centric multi-modal pretraining paradigm called ECLIP in this work. In detail, we craft a decoder architecture that introduces a set of learnable instance queries to explicitly aggregate instance-level semantics. Moreover, to enable the model to focus on the desired product instance without reliance on expensive manual annotations, two specially configured pretext tasks are further proposed. Pretrained on the 100 million E-commerce-related data, ECLIP successfully extracts more generic, semantic-rich, and robust representations. Extensive experimental results show that, without further fine-tuning, ECLIP surpasses existing methods by a large margin on a broad range of downstream tasks, demonstrating the strong transferability to real-world E-commerce applications.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Jin_Learning_Instance-Level_Representation_for_Large-Scale_Multi-Modal_Pretraining_in_E-Commerce_CVPR_2023_paper.html
VLPD: Context-Aware Pedestrian Detection via Vision-Language Semantic Self-Supervision,"Detecting pedestrians accurately in urban scenes is significant for realistic applications like autonomous driving or video surveillance. However, confusing human-like objects often lead to wrong detections, and small scale or heavily occluded pedestrians are easily missed due to their unusual appearances. To address these challenges, only object regions are inadequate, thus how to fully utilize more explicit and semantic contexts becomes a key problem. Meanwhile, previous context-aware pedestrian detectors either only learn latent contexts with visual clues, or need laborious annotations to obtain explicit and semantic contexts. Therefore, we propose in this paper a novel approach via Vision-Language semantic self-supervision for context-aware Pedestrian Detection (VLPD) to model explicitly semantic contexts without any extra annotations. Firstly, we propose a self-supervised Vision-Language Semantic (VLS) segmentation method, which learns both fully-supervised pedestrian detection and contextual segmentation via self-generated explicit labels of semantic classes by vision-language models. Furthermore, a self-supervised Prototypical Semantic Contrastive (PSC) learning method is proposed to better discriminate pedestrians and other classes, based on more explicit and semantic contexts obtained from VLS. Extensive experiments on popular benchmarks show that our proposed VLPD achieves superior performances over the previous state-of-the-arts, particularly under challenging circumstances like small scale and heavy occlusion.

Blind Image Quality Assessment via Vision-Language Correspondence: A Multitask Learning Perspective,"We aim at advancing blind image quality assessment (BIQA), which predicts the human perception of image quality without any reference information. We develop a general and automated multitask learning scheme for BIQA to exploit auxiliary knowledge from other tasks, in a way that the model parameter sharing and the loss weighting are determined automatically. Specifically, we first describe all candidate label combinations (from multiple tasks) using a textual template, and compute the joint probability from the cosine similarities of the visual-textual embeddings. Predictions of each task can be inferred from the joint distribution, and optimized by carefully designed loss functions. Through comprehensive experiments on learning three tasks - BIQA, scene classification, and distortion type identification, we verify that the proposed BIQA method 1) benefits from the scene classification and distortion type identification tasks and outperforms the state-of-the-art on multiple IQA datasets, 2) is more robust in the group maximum differentiation competition, and 3) realigns the quality annotations from different IQA datasets more effectively.

Learning 3D Representations From 2D Pre-Trained Models via Image-to-Point Masked Autoencoders,"Pre-training by numerous image data has become de-facto for robust 2D representations. In contrast, due to the expensive data processing, a paucity of 3D datasets severely hinders the learning for high-quality 3D features. In this paper, we propose an alternative to obtain superior 3D representations from 2D pre-trained models via Image-to-Point Masked Autoencoders, named as I2P-MAE. By self-supervised pre-training, we leverage the well learned 2D knowledge to guide 3D masked autoencoding, which reconstructs the masked point tokens with an encoder-decoder architecture. Specifically, we first utilize off-the-shelf 2D models to extract the multi-view visual features of the input point cloud, and then conduct two types of image-to-point learning schemes. For one, we introduce a 2D-guided masking strategy that maintains semantically important point tokens to be visible. Compared to random masking, the network can better concentrate on significant 3D structures with key spatial cues. For another, we enforce these visible tokens to reconstruct multi-view 2D features after the decoder. This enables the network to effectively inherit high-level 2D semantics for discriminative 3D modeling. Aided by our image-to-point pre-training, the frozen I2P-MAE, without any fine-tuning, achieves 93.4% accuracy for linear SVM on ModelNet40, competitive to existing fully trained methods. By further fine-tuning on on ScanObjectNN's hardest split, I2P-MAE attains the state-of-the-art 90.11% accuracy, +3.68% to the second-best, demonstrating superior transferable capacity.

OVTrack: Open-Vocabulary Multiple Object Tracking,"The ability to recognize, localize and track dynamic objects in a scene is fundamental to many real-world applications, such as self-driving and robotic systems. Yet, traditional multiple object tracking (MOT) benchmarks rely only on a few object categories that hardly represent the multitude of possible objects that are encountered in the real world. This leaves contemporary MOT methods limited to a small set of pre-defined object categories. In this paper, we address this limitation by tackling a novel task, open-vocabulary MOT, that aims to evaluate tracking beyond pre-defined training categories. We further develop OVTrack, an open-vocabulary tracker that is capable of tracking arbitrary object classes. Its design is based on two key ingredients: First, leveraging vision-language models for both classification and association via knowledge distillation; second, a data hallucination strategy for robust appearance feature learning from denoising diffusion probabilistic models. The result is an extremely data-efficient open-vocabulary tracker that sets a new state-of-the-art on the large-scale, large-vocabulary TAO benchmark, while being trained solely on static images. The project page is at https://www.vis.xyz/pub/ovtrack/.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Li_OVTrack_Open-Vocabulary_Multiple_Object_Tracking_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Object-Aware Distillation Pyramid for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection,"Open-vocabulary object detection aims to provide object detectors trained on a fixed set of object categories with the generalizability to detect objects described by arbitrary text queries. Previous methods adopt knowledge distillation to extract knowledge from Pretrained Vision-and-Language Models (PVLMs) and transfer it to detectors. However, due to the non-adaptive proposal cropping and single-level feature mimicking processes, they suffer from information destruction during knowledge extraction and inefficient knowledge transfer. To remedy these limitations, we propose an Object-Aware Distillation Pyramid (OADP) framework, including an Object-Aware Knowledge Extraction (OAKE) module and a Distillation Pyramid (DP) mechanism. When extracting object knowledge from PVLMs, the former adaptively transforms object proposals and adopts object-aware mask attention to obtain precise and complete knowledge of objects. The latter introduces global and block distillation for more comprehensive knowledge transfer to compensate for the missing relation information in object distillation. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves significant improvement compared to current methods. Especially on the MS-COCO dataset, our OADP framework reaches 35.6 mAP^N_50, surpassing the current state-of-the-art method by 3.3 mAP^N_50.

Self-Supervised Image-to-Point Distillation via Semantically Tolerant Contrastive Loss,"An effective framework for learning 3D representations for perception tasks is distilling rich self-supervised image features via contrastive learning. However, image-to-point representation learning for autonomous driving datasets faces two main challenges: 1) the abundance of self-similarity, which results in the contrastive losses pushing away semantically similar point and image regions and thus disturbing the local semantic structure of the learned representations, and 2) severe class imbalance as pretraining gets dominated by over-represented classes. We propose to alleviate the self-similarity problem through a novel semantically tolerant image-to-point contrastive loss that takes into consideration the semantic distance between positive and negative image regions to minimize contrasting semantically similar point and image regions. Additionally, we address class imbalance by designing a class-agnostic balanced loss that approximates the degree of class imbalance through an aggregate sample-to-samples semantic similarity measure. We demonstrate that our semantically-tolerant contrastive loss with class balancing improves state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D representation learning in all evaluation settings on 3D semantic segmentation. Our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 2D-to-3D representation learning frameworks across a wide range of 2D self-supervised pretrained models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Mahmoud_Self-Supervised_Image-to-Point_Distillation_via_Semantically_Tolerant_Contrastive_Loss_CVPR_2023_paper.html
GALIP: Generative Adversarial CLIPs for Text-to-Image Synthesis,"Synthesizing high-fidelity complex images from text is challenging. Based on large pretraining, the autoregressive and diffusion models can synthesize photo-realistic images. Although these large models have shown notable progress, there remain three flaws. 1) These models require tremendous training data and parameters to achieve good performance. 2) The multi-step generation design slows the image synthesis process heavily. 3) The synthesized visual features are challenging to control and require delicately designed prompts. To enable high-quality, efficient, fast, and controllable text-to-image synthesis, we propose Generative Adversarial CLIPs, namely GALIP. GALIP leverages the powerful pretrained CLIP model both in the discriminator and generator. Specifically, we propose a CLIP-based discriminator. The complex scene understanding ability of CLIP enables the discriminator to accurately assess the image quality. Furthermore, we propose a CLIP-empowered generator that induces the visual concepts from CLIP through bridge features and prompts. The CLIP-integrated generator and discriminator boost training efficiency, and as a result, our model only requires about 3% training data and 6% learnable parameters, achieving comparable results to large pretrained autoregressive and diffusion models. Moreover, our model achieves 120 times faster synthesis speed and inherits the smooth latent space from GAN. The extensive experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of our GALIP.

Masked Autoencoding Does Not Help Natural Language Supervision at Scale,"Self supervision and natural language supervision have emerged as two exciting ways to train general purpose image encoders which excel at a variety of downstream tasks. Recent works such as M3AE (Geng et al 2022) and SLIP (Mu et al 2022) have suggested that these approaches can be effectively combined, but most notably their results use small (<20M examples) pre-training datasets and don't effectively reflect the large-scale regime (>100M samples) that is commonly used for these approaches. Here we investigate whether a similar approach can be effective when trained with a much larger amount of data. We find that a combination of two state of the art approaches: masked auto-encoders, MAE (He et al 2021) and contrastive language image pre-training, CLIP (Radford et al 2021) provides a benefit over CLIP when trained on a corpus of 11.3M image-text pairs, but little to no benefit (as evaluated on a suite of common vision tasks) over CLIP when trained on a large corpus of 1.4B images. Our work provides some much needed clarity into the effectiveness (or lack thereof) of self supervision for large-scale image-text training.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Weers_Masked_Autoencoding_Does_Not_Help_Natural_Language_Supervision_at_Scale_CVPR_2023_paper.html
CORA: Adapting CLIP for Open-Vocabulary Detection With Region Prompting and Anchor Pre-Matching,"Open-vocabulary detection (OVD) is an object detection task aiming at detecting objects from novel categories beyond the base categories on which the detector is trained. Recent OVD methods rely on large-scale visual-language pre-trained models, such as CLIP, for recognizing novel objects. We identify the two core obstacles that need to be tackled when incorporating these models into detector training: (1) the distribution mismatch that happens when applying a VL-model trained on whole images to region recognition tasks; (2) the difficulty of localizing objects of unseen classes. To overcome these obstacles, we propose CORA, a DETR-style framework that adapts CLIP for Open-vocabulary detection by Region prompting and Anchor pre-matching. Region prompting mitigates the whole-to-region distribution gap by prompting the region features of the CLIP-based region classifier. Anchor pre-matching helps learning generalizable object localization by a class-aware matching mechanism. We evaluate CORA on the COCO OVD benchmark, where we achieve 41.7 AP50 on novel classes, which outperforms the previous SOTA by 2.4 AP50 even without resorting to extra training data. When extra training data is available, we train CORA+ on both ground-truth base-category annotations and additional pseudo bounding box labels computed by CORA. CORA+ achieves 43.1 AP50 on the COCO OVD benchmark and 28.1 box APr on the LVIS OVD benchmark.

Doubly Right Object Recognition: A Why Prompt for Visual Rationales,"Many visual recognition models are evaluated only on their classification accuracy, a metric for which they obtain strong performance. In this paper, we investigate whether computer vision models can also provide correct rationales for their predictions. We propose a ""doubly right"" object recognition benchmark, where the metric requires the model to simultaneously produce both the right labels as well as the right rationales. We find that state-of-the-art visual models, such as CLIP, often provide incorrect rationales for their categorical predictions. However, by transferring the rationales from language models into visual representations through a tailored dataset, we show that we can learn a ""why prompt,"" which adapts large visual representations to produce correct rationales. Visualizations and empirical experiments show that our prompts significantly improve performance on doubly right object recognition, in addition to zero-shot transfer to unseen tasks and datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Mao_Doubly_Right_Object_Recognition_A_Why_Prompt_for_Visual_Rationales_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning Geometry-Aware Representations by Sketching,"Understanding geometric concepts, such as distance and shape, is essential for understanding the real world and also for many vision tasks. To incorporate such information into a visual representation of a scene, we propose learning to represent the scene by sketching, inspired by human behavior. Our method, coined Learning by Sketching (LBS), learns to convert an image into a set of colored strokes that explicitly incorporate the geometric information of the scene in a single inference step without requiring a sketch dataset. A sketch is then generated from the strokes where CLIP-based perceptual loss maintains a semantic similarity between the sketch and the image. We show theoretically that sketching is equivariant with respect to arbitrary affine transformations and thus provably preserves geometric information. Experimental results show that LBS substantially improves the performance of object attribute classification on the unlabeled CLEVR dataset, domain transfer between CLEVR and STL-10 datasets, and for diverse downstream tasks, confirming that LBS provides rich geometric information.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Lee_Learning_Geometry-Aware_Representations_by_Sketching_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Unsupervised 3D Point Cloud Representation Learning by Triangle Constrained Contrast for Autonomous Driving,"Due to the difficulty of annotating the 3D LiDAR data of autonomous driving, an efficient unsupervised 3D representation learning method is important. In this paper, we design the Triangle Constrained Contrast (TriCC) framework tailored for autonomous driving scenes which learns 3D unsupervised representations through both the multimodal information and dynamic of temporal sequences. We treat one camera image and two LiDAR point clouds with different timestamps as a triplet. And our key design is the consistent constraint that automatically finds matching relationships among the triplet through ""self-cycle"" and learns representations from it. With the matching relations across the temporal dimension and modalities, we can further conduct a triplet contrast to improve learning efficiency. To the best of our knowledge, TriCC is the first framework that unifies both the temporal and multimodal semantics, which means it utilizes almost all the information in autonomous driving scenes. And compared with previous contrastive methods, it can automatically dig out contrasting pairs with higher difficulty, instead of relying on handcrafted ones. Extensive experiments are conducted with Minkowski-UNet and VoxelNet on several semantic segmentation and 3D detection datasets. Results show that TriCC learns effective representations with much fewer training iterations and improves the SOTA results greatly on all the downstream tasks.

Efficient Multimodal Fusion via Interactive Prompting,"Large-scale pre-training has brought unimodal fields such as computer vision and natural language processing to a new era. Following this trend, the size of multimodal learning models constantly increases, leading to an urgent need to reduce the massive computational cost of fine-tuning these models for downstream tasks. In this paper, we propose an efficient and flexible multimodal fusion method, namely PMF, tailored for fusing unimodally pretrained transformers. Specifically, we first present a modular multimodal fusion framework that exhibits high flexibility and facilitates mutual interactions among different modalities. In addition, we disentangle vanilla prompts into three types in order to learn different optimizing objectives for multimodal learning. It is also worth noting that we propose to add prompt vectors only on the deep layers of the unimodal transformers, thus significantly reducing the training memory usage. Experiment results show that our proposed method achieves comparable performance to several other multimodal finetuning methods with less than 3% trainable parameters and up to 66% saving of training memory usage.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Li_Efficient_Multimodal_Fusion_via_Interactive_Prompting_CVPR_2023_paper.html
ImageBind: One Embedding Space To Bind Them All,"We present ImageBind, an approach to learn a joint embedding across six different modalities - images, text, audio, depth, thermal, and IMU data. We show that all combinations of paired data are not necessary to train such a joint embedding, and only image-paired data is sufficient to bind the modalities together. ImageBind can leverage recent large scale vision-language models, and extends their zero-shot capabilities to new modalities just by using their natural pairing with images. It enables novel emergent applications 'out-of-the-box' including cross-modal retrieval, composing modalities with arithmetic, cross-modal detection and generation. The emergent capabilities improve with the strength of the image encoder and we set a new state-of-the-art on emergent zero-shot recognition tasks across modalities, outperforming specialist supervised models. Finally, we show strong few-shot recognition results outperforming prior work, and that ImageBind serves as a new way to evaluate vision models for visual and non-visual tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Girdhar_ImageBind_One_Embedding_Space_To_Bind_Them_All_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Turning a CLIP Model Into a Scene Text Detector,"The recent large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining (CLIP) model has shown great potential in various downstream tasks via leveraging the pretrained vision and language knowledge. Scene text, which contains rich textual and visual information, has an inherent connection with a model like CLIP. Recently, pretraining approaches based on vision language models have made effective progresses in the field of text detection. In contrast to these works, this paper proposes a new method, termed TCM, focusing on Turning the CLIP Model directly for text detection without pretraining process. We demonstrate the advantages of the proposed TCM as follows: (1) The underlying principle of our framework can be applied to improve existing scene text detector. (2) It facilitates the few-shot training capability of existing methods, e.g., by using 10% of labeled data, we significantly improve the performance of the baseline method with an average of 22% in terms of the F-measure on 4 benchmarks. (3) By turning the CLIP model into existing scene text detection methods, we further achieve promising domain adaptation ability. The code will be publicly released at https://github.com/wenwenyu/TCM.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yu_Turning_a_CLIP_Model_Into_a_Scene_Text_Detector_CVPR_2023_paper.html
ProTeGe: Untrimmed Pretraining for Video Temporal Grounding by Video Temporal Grounding,"Video temporal grounding (VTG) is the task of localizing a given natural language text query in an arbitrarily long untrimmed video. While the task involves untrimmed videos, all existing VTG methods leverage features from video backbones pretrained on trimmed videos. This is largely due to the lack of large-scale well-annotated VTG dataset to perform pretraining. As a result, the pretrained features lack a notion of temporal boundaries leading to the video-text alignment being less distinguishable between correct and incorrect locations. We present ProTeGe as the first method to perform VTG-based untrimmed pretraining to bridge the gap between trimmed pretrained backbones and downstream VTG tasks. ProTeGe reconfigures the HowTo100M dataset, with noisily correlated video-text pairs, into a VTG dataset and introduces a novel Video-Text Similarity-based Grounding Module and a pretraining objective to make pretraining robust to noise in HowTo100M. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets across downstream tasks with all variations of supervision validate that pretrained features from ProTeGe can significantly outperform features from trimmed pretrained backbones on VTG.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wang_ProTeGe_Untrimmed_Pretraining_for_Video_Temporal_Grounding_by_Video_Temporal_CVPR_2023_paper.html
"ULIP: Learning a Unified Representation of Language, Images, and Point Clouds for 3D Understanding","The recognition capabilities of current state-of-the-art 3D models are limited by datasets with a small number of annotated data and a pre-defined set of categories. In its 2D counterpart, recent advances have shown that similar problems can be significantly alleviated by employing knowledge from other modalities, such as language. Inspired by this, leveraging multimodal information for 3D modality could be promising to improve 3D understanding under the restricted data regime, but this line of research is not well studied. Therefore, we introduce ULIP to learn a unified representation of images, language, and 3D point clouds by pre-training with object triplets from the three modalities. To overcome the shortage of training triplets, ULIP leverages a pre-trained vision-language model that has already learned a common visual and textual space by training with massive image-text pairs. Then, ULIP learns a 3D representation space aligned with the common image-text space, using a small number of automatically synthesized triplets. ULIP is agnostic to 3D backbone networks and can easily be integrated into any 3D architecture. Experiments show that ULIP effectively improves the performance of multiple recent 3D backbones by simply pre-training them on ShapeNet55 using our framework, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both standard 3D classification and zero-shot 3D classification on ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN. ULIP also improves the performance of PointMLP by around 3% in 3D classification on ScanObjectNN, and outperforms PointCLIP by 28.8% on top-1 accuracy for zero-shot 3D classification on ModelNet40. Our code and pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/salesforce/ULIP.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Gao_ULIP_Learning_a_Unified_Representation_of_Language_Images_and_Point_CVPR_2023_paper.html
EVA: Exploring the Limits of Masked Visual Representation Learning at Scale,"We launch EVA, a vision-centric foundation model to explore the limits of visual representation at scale using only publicly accessible data. EVA is a vanilla ViT pre-trained to reconstruct the masked out image-text aligned vision features conditioned on visible image patches. Via this pretext task, we can efficiently scale up EVA to one billion parameters, and sets new records on a broad range of representative vision downstream tasks, such as image recognition, video action recognition, object detection, instance segmentation and semantic segmentation without heavy supervised training. Moreover, we observe quantitative changes in scaling EVA result in qualitative changes in transfer learning performance that are not present in other models. For instance, EVA takes a great leap in the challenging large vocabulary instance segmentation task: our model achieves almost the same state-of-the-art performance on LVIS dataset with over a thousand categories and COCO dataset with only eighty categories. Beyond a pure vision encoder, EVA can also serve as a vision-centric, multi-modal pivot to connect images and text. We find initializing the vision tower of a giant CLIP from EVA can greatly stabilize the training and outperform the training from scratch counterpart with much fewer samples and less compute, providing a new direction for scaling up and accelerating the costly training of multi-modal foundation models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Fang_EVA_Exploring_the_Limits_of_Masked_Visual_Representation_Learning_at_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning Multi-Modal Class-Specific Tokens for Weakly Supervised Dense Object Localization,"Weakly supervised dense object localization (WSDOL) relies generally on Class Activation Mapping (CAM), which exploits the correlation between the class weights of the image classifier and the pixel-level features. Due to the limited ability to address intra-class variations, the image classifier cannot properly associate the pixel features, leading to inaccurate dense localization maps. In this paper, we propose to explicitly construct multi-modal class representations by leveraging the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), to guide dense localization. More specifically, we propose a unified transformer framework to learn two-modalities of class-specific tokens, i.e., class-specific visual and textual tokens. The former captures semantics from the target visual data while the latter exploits the class-related language priors from CLIP, providing complementary information to better perceive the intra-class diversities. In addition, we propose to enrich the multi-modal class-specific tokens with sample-specific contexts comprising visual context and image-language context. This enables more adaptive class representation learning, which further facilitates dense localization. Extensive experiments show the superiority of the proposed method for WSDOL on two multi-label datasets, i.e., PASCAL VOC and MS COCO, and one single-label dataset, i.e., OpenImages. Our dense localization maps also lead to the state-of-the-art weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) results on PASCAL VOC and MS COCO.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Xu_Learning_Multi-Modal_Class-Specific_Tokens_for_Weakly_Supervised_Dense_Object_Localization_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning Emotion Representations From Verbal and Nonverbal Communication,"Emotion understanding is an essential but highly challenging component of artificial general intelligence. The absence of extensive annotated datasets has significantly impeded advancements in this field. We present EmotionCLIP, the first pre-training paradigm to extract visual emotion representations from verbal and nonverbal communication using only uncurated data. Compared to numerical labels or descriptions used in previous methods, communication naturally contains emotion information. Furthermore, acquiring emotion representations from communication is more congruent with the human learning process. We guide EmotionCLIP to attend to nonverbal emotion cues through subject-aware context encoding and verbal emotion cues using sentiment-guided contrastive learning. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness and transferability of EmotionCLIP. Using merely linear-probe evaluation protocol, EmotionCLIP outperforms the state-of-the-art supervised visual emotion recognition methods and rivals many multimodal approaches across various benchmarks. We anticipate that the advent of EmotionCLIP will address the prevailing issue of data scarcity in emotion understanding, thereby fostering progress in related domains. The code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/Xeaver/EmotionCLIP.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zhang_Learning_Emotion_Representations_From_Verbal_and_Nonverbal_Communication_CVPR_2023_paper.html
All in One: Exploring Unified Video-Language Pre-Training,"Mainstream Video-Language Pre-training models consist of three parts, a video encoder, a text encoder, and a video-text fusion Transformer. They pursue better performance via utilizing heavier unimodal encoders or multimodal fusion Transformers, resulting in increased parameters with lower efficiency in downstream tasks. In this work, we for the first time introduce an end-to-end video-language model, namely all-in-one Transformer, that embeds raw video and textual signals into joint representations using a unified backbone architecture. We argue that the unique temporal information of video data turns out to be a key barrier hindering the design of a modality-agnostic Transformer. To overcome the challenge, we introduce a novel and effective token rolling operation to encode temporal representations from video clips in a non-parametric manner. The careful design enables the representation learning of both video-text multimodal inputs and unimodal inputs using a unified backbone model. Our pre-trained all-in-one Transformer is transferred to various downstream video-text tasks after fine-tuning, including text-video retrieval, video-question answering, multiple choice and visual commonsense reasoning. State-of-the-art performances with the minimal model FLOPs on nine datasets demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to the competitive counterparts.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wang_All_in_One_Exploring_Unified_Video-Language_Pre-Training_CVPR_2023_paper.html
VILA: Learning Image Aesthetics From User Comments With Vision-Language Pretraining,"Assessing the aesthetics of an image is challenging, as it is influenced by multiple factors including composition, color, style, and high-level semantics. Existing image aesthetic assessment (IAA) methods primarily rely on human-labeled rating scores, which oversimplify the visual aesthetic information that humans perceive. Conversely, user comments offer more comprehensive information and are a more natural way to express human opinions and preferences regarding image aesthetics. In light of this, we propose learning image aesthetics from user comments, and exploring vision-language pretraining methods to learn multimodal aesthetic representations. Specifically, we pretrain an image-text encoder-decoder model with image-comment pairs, using contrastive and generative objectives to learn rich and generic aesthetic semantics without human labels. To efficiently adapt the pretrained model for downstream IAA tasks, we further propose a lightweight rank-based adapter that employs text as an anchor to learn the aesthetic ranking concept. Our results show that our pretrained aesthetic vision-language model outperforms prior works on image aesthetic captioning over the AVA-Captions dataset, and it has powerful zero-shot capability for aesthetic tasks such as zero-shot style classification and zero-shot IAA, surpassing many supervised baselines. With only minimal finetuning parameters using the proposed adapter module, our model achieves state-of-the-art IAA performance over the AVA dataset.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Ke_VILA_Learning_Image_Aesthetics_From_User_Comments_With_Vision-Language_Pretraining_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Procedure-Aware Pretraining for Instructional Video Understanding,"Our goal is to learn a video representation that is useful for downstream procedure understanding tasks in instructional videos. Due to the small amount of available annotations, a key challenge in procedure understanding is to be able to extract from unlabeled videos the procedural knowledge such as the identity of the task (e.g., 'make latte'), its steps (e.g., 'pour milk'), or the potential next steps given partial progress in its execution. Our main insight is that instructional videos depict sequences of steps that repeat between instances of the same or different tasks, and that this structure can be well represented by a Procedural Knowledge Graph (PKG), where nodes are discrete steps and edges connect steps that occur sequentially in the instructional activities. This graph can then be used to generate pseudo labels to train a video representation that encodes the procedural knowledge in a more accessible form to generalize to multiple procedure understanding tasks. We build a PKG by combining information from a text-based procedural knowledge database and an unlabeled instructional video corpus and then use it to generate training pseudo labels with four novel pre-training objectives. We call this PKG-based pre-training procedure and the resulting model Paprika, Procedure-Aware PRe-training for Instructional Knowledge Acquisition. We evaluate Paprika on COIN and CrossTask for procedure understanding tasks such as task recognition, step recognition, and step forecasting. Paprika yields a video representation that improves over the state of the art: up to 11.23% gains in accuracy in 12 evaluation settings. Implementation is available at https://github.com/salesforce/paprika.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zhou_Procedure-Aware_Pretraining_for_Instructional_Video_Understanding_CVPR_2023_paper.html
EXIF As Language: Learning Cross-Modal Associations Between Images and Camera Metadata,"We learn a visual representation that captures information about the camera that recorded a given photo. To do this, we train a multimodal embedding between image patches and the EXIF metadata that cameras automatically insert into image files. Our model represents this metadata by simply converting it to text and then processing it with a transformer. The features that we learn significantly outperform other self-supervised and supervised features on downstream image forensics and calibration tasks. In particular, we successfully localize spliced image regions ""zero shot"" by clustering the visual embeddings for all of the patches within an image.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zheng_EXIF_As_Language_Learning_Cross-Modal_Associations_Between_Images_and_Camera_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Task Residual for Tuning Vision-Language Models,"Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on billion-level data have learned general visual representations and broad visual concepts. In principle, the well-learned knowledge structure of the VLMs should be inherited appropriately when being transferred to downstream tasks with limited data. However, most existing efficient transfer learning (ETL) approaches for VLMs either damage or are excessively biased towards the prior knowledge, e.g., prompt tuning (PT) discards the pre-trained text-based classifier and builds a new one while adapter-style tuning (AT) fully relies on the pre-trained features. To address this, we propose a new efficient tuning approach for VLMs named Task Residual Tuning (TaskRes), which performs directly on the text-based classifier and explicitly decouples the prior knowledge of the pre-trained models and new knowledge regarding a target task. Specifically, TaskRes keeps the original classifier weights from the VLMs frozen and obtains a new classifier for the target task by tuning a set of prior-independent parameters as a residual to the original one, which enables reliable prior knowledge preservation and flexible task-specific knowledge exploration. The proposed TaskRes is simple yet effective, which significantly outperforms previous ETL methods (e.g., PT and AT) on 11 benchmark datasets while requiring minimal effort for the implementation. Our code is available at https://github.com/geekyutao/TaskRes.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yu_Task_Residual_for_Tuning_Vision-Language_Models_CVPR_2023_paper.html
FashionSAP: Symbols and Attributes Prompt for Fine-Grained Fashion Vision-Language Pre-Training,"Fashion vision-language pre-training models have shown efficacy for a wide range of downstream tasks. However, general vision-language pre-training models pay less attention to fine-grained domain features, while these features are important in distinguishing the specific domain tasks from general tasks. We propose a method for fine-grained fashion vision-language pre-training based on fashion Symbols and Attributes Prompt (FashionSAP) to model fine-grained multi-modalities fashion attributes and characteristics. Firstly, we propose the fashion symbols, a novel abstract fashion concept layer, to represent different fashion items and to generalize various kinds of fine-grained fashion features, making modelling fine-grained attributes more effective. Secondly, the attributes prompt method is proposed to make the model learn specific attributes of fashion items explicitly. We design proper prompt templates according to the format of fashion data. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on two public fashion benchmarks, i.e., FashionGen and FashionIQ, and FashionSAP gets SOTA performances for four popular fashion tasks. The ablation study also shows the proposed abstract fashion symbols, and the attribute prompt method enables the model to acquire fine-grained semantics in the fashion domain effectively. The obvious performance gains from FashionSAP provide a new baseline for future fashion task research.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Han_FashionSAP_Symbols_and_Attributes_Prompt_for_Fine-Grained_Fashion_Vision-Language_Pre-Training_CVPR_2023_paper.html
DetCLIPv2: Scalable Open-Vocabulary Object Detection Pre-Training via Word-Region Alignment,"This paper presents DetCLIPv2, an efficient and scalable training framework that incorporates large-scale image-text pairs to achieve open-vocabulary object detection (OVD). Unlike previous OVD frameworks that typically rely on a pre-trained vision-language model (e.g., CLIP) or exploit image-text pairs via a pseudo labeling process, DetCLIPv2 directly learns the fine-grained word-region alignment from massive image-text pairs in an end-to-end manner. To accomplish this, we employ a maximum word-region similarity between region proposals and textual words to guide the contrastive objective. To enable the model to gain localization capability while learning broad concepts, DetCLIPv2 is trained with a hybrid supervision from detection, grounding and image-text pair data under a unified data formulation. By jointly training with an alternating scheme and adopting low-resolution input for image-text pairs, DetCLIPv2 exploits image-text pair data efficiently and effectively: DetCLIPv2 utilizes 13x more image-text pairs than DetCLIP with a similar training time and improves performance. With 13M image-text pairs for pre-training, DetCLIPv2 demonstrates superior open-vocabulary detection performance, e.g., DetCLIPv2 with Swin-T backbone achieves 40.4% zero-shot AP on the LVIS benchmark, which outperforms previous works GLIP/GLIPv2/DetCLIP by 14.4/11.4/4.5% AP, respectively, and even beats its fully-supervised counterpart by a large margin.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yao_DetCLIPv2_Scalable_Open-Vocabulary_Object_Detection_Pre-Training_via_Word-Region_Alignment_CVPR_2023_paper.html
"Filtering, Distillation, and Hard Negatives for Vision-Language Pre-Training","Vision-language models trained with contrastive learning on large-scale noisy data are becoming increasingly popular for zero-shot recognition problems. In this paper we improve the following three aspects of the contrastive pre-training pipeline: dataset noise, model initialization and the training objective. First, we propose a straightforward filtering strategy titled Complexity, Action, and Text-spotting (CAT) that significantly reduces dataset size, while achieving improved performance across zero-shot vision-language tasks. Next, we propose an approach titled Concept Distillation to leverage strong unimodal representations for contrastive training that does not increase training complexity while outperforming prior work. Finally, we modify the traditional contrastive alignment objective, and propose an importance-sampling approach to up-sample the importance of hard-negatives without adding additional complexity. On an extensive zero-shot benchmark of 29 tasks, our Distilled and Hard-negative Training (DiHT) approach improves on 20 tasks compared to the baseline. Furthermore, for few-shot linear probing, we propose a novel approach that bridges the gap between zero-shot and few-shot performance, substantially improving over prior work.

"Unifying Vision, Text, and Layout for Universal Document Processing","We propose Universal Document Processing (UDOP), a foundation Document AI model which unifies text, image, and layout modalities together with varied task formats, including document understanding and generation. UDOP leverages the spatial correlation between textual content and document image to model image, text, and layout modalities with one uniform representation. With a novel Vision-Text-Layout Transformer, UDOP unifies pretraining and multi-domain downstream tasks into a prompt-based sequence generation scheme. UDOP is pretrained on both large-scale unlabeled document corpora using innovative self-supervised objectives and diverse labeled data. UDOP also learns to generate document images from text and layout modalities via masked image reconstruction. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time in the field of document AI that one model simultaneously achieves high-quality neural document editing and content customization. Our method sets the state-of-the-art on 8 Document AI tasks, e.g., document understanding and QA, across diverse data domains like finance reports, academic papers, and websites.

Probing Sentiment-Oriented Pre-Training Inspired by Human Sentiment Perception Mechanism,"Pre-training of deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) plays a crucial role in the field of visual sentiment analysis (VSA). Most proposed methods employ the off-the-shelf backbones pre-trained on large-scale object classification datasets (i.e., ImageNet). While it boosts performance for a big margin against initializing model states from random, we argue that DCNNs simply pre-trained on ImageNet may excessively focus on recognizing objects, but failed to provide high-level concepts in terms of sentiment. To address this long-term overlooked problem, we propose a sentiment-oriented pre-training method that is built upon human visual sentiment perception (VSP) mechanism. Specifically, we factorize the process of VSP into three steps, namely stimuli taking, holistic organizing, and high-level perceiving. From imitating each VSP step, a total of three models are separately pre-trained via our devised sentiment-aware tasks that contribute to excavating sentiment-discriminated representations. Moreover, along with our elaborated multi-model amalgamation strategy, the prior knowledge learned from each perception step can be effectively transferred into a single target model, yielding substantial performance gains. Finally, we verify the superiorities of our proposed method over extensive experiments, covering mainstream VSA tasks from single-label learning (SLL), multi-label learning (MLL), to label distribution learning (LDL). Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed method leads to unanimous improvements in these downstream tasks.

TOPLight: Lightweight Neural Networks With Task-Oriented Pretraining for Visible-Infrared Recognition,"Visible-infrared recognition (VI recognition) is a challenging task due to the enormous visual difference across heterogeneous images. Most existing works achieve promising results by transfer learning, such as pretraining on the ImageNet, based on advanced neural architectures like ResNet and ViT. However, such methods ignore the negative influence of the pretrained colour prior knowledge, as well as their heavy computational burden makes them hard to deploy in actual scenarios with limited resources. In this paper, we propose a novel task-oriented pretrained lightweight neural network (TOPLight) for VI recognition. Specifically, the TOPLight method simulates the domain conflict and sample variations with the proposed fake domain loss in the pretraining stage, which guides the network to learn how to handle those difficulties, such that a more general modality-shared feature representation is learned for the heterogeneous images. Moreover, an effective fine-grained dependency reconstruction module (FDR) is developed to discover substantial pattern dependencies shared in two modalities. Extensive experiments on VI person re-identification and VI face recognition datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed TOPLight, which significantly outperforms the current state of the arts while demanding fewer computational resources.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yu_TOPLight_Lightweight_Neural_Networks_With_Task-Oriented_Pretraining_for_Visible-Infrared_Recognition_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Critical Learning Periods for Multisensory Integration in Deep Networks,"We show that the ability of a neural network to integrate information from diverse sources hinges critically on being exposed to properly correlated signals during the early phases of training. Interfering with the learning process during this initial stage can permanently impair the development of a skill, both in artificial and biological systems where the phenomenon is known as a critical learning period. We show that critical periods arise from the complex and unstable early transient dynamics, which are decisive of final performance of the trained system and their learned representations. This evidence challenges the view, engendered by analysis of wide and shallow networks, that early learning dynamics of neural networks are simple, akin to those of a linear model. Indeed, we show that even deep linear networks exhibit critical learning periods for multi-source integration, while shallow networks do not. To better understand how the internal representations change according to disturbances or sensory deficits, we introduce a new measure of source sensitivity, which allows us to track the inhibition and integration of sources during training. Our analysis of inhibition suggests cross-source reconstruction as a natural auxiliary training objective, and indeed we show that architectures trained with cross-sensor reconstruction objectives are remarkably more resilient to critical periods. Our findings suggest that the recent success in self-supervised multi-modal training compared to previous supervised efforts may be in part due to more robust learning dynamics and not solely due to better architectures and/or more data.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Kleinman_Critical_Learning_Periods_for_Multisensory_Integration_in_Deep_Networks_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Movies2Scenes: Using Movie Metadata To Learn Scene Representation,"Understanding scenes in movies is crucial for a variety of applications such as video moderation, search, and recommendation. However, labeling individual scenes is a time-consuming process. In contrast, movie level metadata (e.g., genre, synopsis, etc.) regularly gets produced as part of the film production process, and is therefore significantly more commonly available. In this work, we propose a novel contrastive learning approach that uses movie metadata to learn a general-purpose scene representation. Specifically, we use movie metadata to define a measure of movie similarity, and use it during contrastive learning to limit our search for positive scene-pairs to only the movies that are considered similar to each other. Our learned scene representation consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on a diverse set of tasks evaluated using multiple benchmark datasets. Notably, our learned representation offers an average improvement of 7.9% on the seven classification tasks and 9.7% improvement on the two regression tasks in LVU dataset. Furthermore, using a newly collected movie dataset, we present comparative results of our scene representation on a set of video moderation tasks to demonstrate its generalizability on previously less explored tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Chen_Movies2Scenes_Using_Movie_Metadata_To_Learn_Scene_Representation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Region-Aware Pretraining for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection With Vision Transformers,"We present Region-aware Open-vocabulary Vision Transformers (RO-ViT) -- a contrastive image-text pretraining recipe to bridge the gap between image-level pretraining and open-vocabulary object detection. At the pretraining phase, we propose to randomly crop and resize regions of positional embeddings instead of using the whole image positional embeddings. This better matches the use of positional embeddings at region-level in the detection finetuning phase. In addition, we replace the common softmax cross entropy loss in contrastive learning with focal loss to better learn the informative yet difficult examples. Finally, we leverage recent advances in novel object proposals to improve open-vocabulary detection finetuning. We evaluate our full model on the LVIS and COCO open-vocabulary detection benchmarks and zero-shot transfer. RO-ViT achieves a state-of-the-art 32.1 APr on LVIS, surpassing the best existing approach by +5.8 points in addition to competitive zero-shot transfer detection. Surprisingly, RO-ViT improves the image-level representation as well and achieves the state of the art on 9 out of 12 metrics on COCO and Flickr image-text retrieval benchmarks, outperforming competitive approaches with larger models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Kim_Region-Aware_Pretraining_for_Open-Vocabulary_Object_Detection_With_Vision_Transformers_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning Transferable Spatiotemporal Representations From Natural Script Knowledge,"Pre-training on large-scale video data has become a common recipe for learning transferable spatiotemporal representations in recent years. Despite some progress, existing methods are mostly limited to highly curated datasets (e.g., K400) and exhibit unsatisfactory out-of-the-box representations. We argue that it is due to the fact that they only capture pixel-level knowledge rather than spatiotemporal semantics, which hinders further progress in video understanding. Inspired by the great success of image-text pre-training (e.g., CLIP), we take the first step to exploit language semantics to boost transferable spatiotemporal representation learning. We introduce a new pretext task, Turning to Video for Transcript Sorting (TVTS), which sorts shuffled ASR scripts by attending to learned video representations. We do not rely on descriptive captions and learn purely from video, i.e., leveraging the natural transcribed speech knowledge to provide noisy but useful semantics over time. Our method enforces the vision model to contextualize what is happening over time so that it can re-organize the narrative transcripts, and can seamlessly apply to large-scale uncurated video data in the real world. Our method demonstrates strong out-of-the-box spatiotemporal representations on diverse benchmarks, e.g., +13.6% gains over VideoMAE on SSV2 via linear probing. The code is available at https://github.com/TencentARC/TVTS.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zeng_Learning_Transferable_Spatiotemporal_Representations_From_Natural_Script_Knowledge_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Open-Vocabulary Point-Cloud Object Detection Without 3D Annotation,"The goal of open-vocabulary detection is to identify novel objects based on arbitrary textual descriptions. In this paper, we address open-vocabulary 3D point-cloud detection by a dividing-and-conquering strategy, which involves: 1) developing a point-cloud detector that can learn a general representation for localizing various objects, and 2) connecting textual and point-cloud representations to enable the detector to classify novel object categories based on text prompting. Specifically, we resort to rich image pre-trained models, by which the point-cloud detector learns localizing objects under the supervision of predicted 2D bounding boxes from 2D pre-trained detectors. Moreover, we propose a novel de-biased triplet cross-modal contrastive learning to connect the modalities of image, point-cloud and text, thereby enabling the point-cloud detector to benefit from vision-language pre-trained models, i.e., CLIP. The novel use of image and vision-language pre-trained models for point-cloud detectors allows for open-vocabulary 3D object detection without the need for 3D annotations. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves at least 3.03 points and 7.47 points over a wide range of baselines on the ScanNet and SUN RGB-D datasets, respectively.

Emerging backdoor attacks towards encoders expose crucial vulnerabilities of self-supervised learning, since downstream classifiers (even further trained on clean data) may inherit backdoor behaviors from encoders. Existing backdoor detection methods mainly focus on supervised learning settings and cannot handle pre-trained encoders especially when input labels are not available. In this paper, we propose DECREE, the first backdoor detection approach for pre-trained encoders, requiring neither classifier headers nor input labels. We evaluate DECREE on over 400 encoders trojaned under 3 paradigms. We show the effectiveness of our method on image encoders pre-trained on ImageNet and OpenAI's CLIP 400 million image-text pairs. Our method consistently has a high detection accuracy even if we have only limited or no access to the pre-training dataset.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Feng_Detecting_Backdoors_in_Pre-Trained_Encoders_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Image as a Foreign Language: BEiT Pretraining for Vision and Vision-Language Tasks,"A big convergence of language, vision, and multimodal pretraining is emerging. In this work, we introduce a general-purpose multimodal foundation model BEiT-3, which achieves excellent transfer performance on both vision and vision-language tasks. Specifically, we advance the big convergence from three aspects: backbone architecture, pretraining task, and model scaling up. We use Multiway Transformers for general-purpose modeling, where the modular architecture enables both deep fusion and modality-specific encoding. Based on the shared backbone, we perform masked ""language"" modeling on images (Imglish), texts (English), and image-text pairs (""parallel sentences"") in a unified manner. Experimental results show that BEiT-3 obtains remarkable performance on object detection (COCO), semantic segmentation (ADE20K), image classification (ImageNet), visual reasoning (NLVR2), visual question answering (VQAv2), image captioning (COCO), and cross-modal retrieval (Flickr30K, COCO).",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wang_Image_as_a_Foreign_Language_BEiT_Pretraining_for_Vision_and_CVPR_2023_paper.html
LAVENDER: Unifying Video-Language Understanding As Masked Language Modeling,"Unified vision-language frameworks have greatly advanced in recent years, most of which adopt an encoder-decoder architecture to unify image-text tasks as sequence-to-sequence generation. However, existing video-language (VidL) models still require task-specific designs in model architecture and training objectives for each task. In this work, we explore a unified VidL framework LAVENDER, where Masked Language Modeling (MLM) is used as the common interface for all pre-training and downstream tasks. Such unification leads to a simplified model architecture, where only a lightweight MLM head, instead of a decoder with much more parameters, is needed on top of the multimodal encoder. Surprisingly, experimental results show that this unified framework achieves competitive performance on 14 VidL benchmarks, covering video question answering, text-to-video retrieval and video captioning. Extensive analyses further demonstrate LAVENDER can (i) seamlessly support all downstream tasks with just a single set of parameter values when multi-task finetuned; (ii) generalize to various downstream tasks with limited training samples; and (iii) enable zero-shot evaluation on video question answering tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Li_LAVENDER_Unifying_Video-Language_Understanding_As_Masked_Language_Modeling_CVPR_2023_paper.html
OvarNet: Towards Open-Vocabulary Object Attribute Recognition,"In this paper, we consider the problem of simultaneously detecting objects and inferring their visual attributes in an image, even for those with no manual annotations provided at the training stage, resembling an open-vocabulary scenario. To achieve this goal, we make the following contributions: (i) we start with a naive two-stage approach for open-vocabulary object detection and attribute classification, termed CLIP-Attr. The candidate objects are first proposed with an offline RPN and later classified for semantic category and attributes; (ii) we combine all available datasets and train with a federated strategy to finetune the CLIP model, aligning the visual representation with attributes, additionally, we investigate the efficacy of leveraging freely available online image-caption pairs under weakly supervised learning; (iii) in pursuit of efficiency, we train a Faster-RCNN type model end-to-end with knowledge distillation, that performs class-agnostic object proposals and classification on semantic categories and attributes with classifiers generated from a text encoder; Finally, (iv) we conduct extensive experiments on VAW, MS-COCO, LSA, and OVAD datasets, and show that recognition of semantic category and attributes is complementary for visual scene understanding, i.e., jointly training object detection and attributes prediction largely outperform existing approaches that treat the two tasks independently, demonstrating strong generalization ability to novel attributes and categories.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Chen_OvarNet_Towards_Open-Vocabulary_Object_Attribute_Recognition_CVPR_2023_paper.html
EC2: Emergent Communication for Embodied Control,"Embodied control requires agents to leverage multi-modal pre-training to quickly learn how to act in new environments, where video demonstrations contain visual and motion details needed for low-level perception and control, and language instructions support generalization with abstract, symbolic structures. While recent approaches apply contrastive learning to force alignment between the two modalities, we hypothesize better modeling their complementary differences can lead to more holistic representations for downstream adaption. To this end, we propose Emergent Communication for Embodied Control (EC^2), a novel scheme to pre-train video-language representations for few-shot embodied control. The key idea is to learn an unsupervised ""language"" of videos via emergent communication, which bridges the semantics of video details and structures of natural language. We learn embodied representations of video trajectories, emergent language, and natural language using a language model, which is then used to finetune a lightweight policy network for downstream control. Through extensive experiments in Metaworld and Franka Kitchen embodied benchmarks, EC^2 is shown to consistently outperform previous contrastive learning methods for both videos and texts as task inputs. Further ablations confirm the importance of the emergent language, which is beneficial for both video and language learning, and significantly superior to using pre-trained video captions. We also present a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the emergent language and discuss future directions toward better understanding and leveraging emergent communication in embodied tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Mu_EC2_Emergent_Communication_for_Embodied_Control_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Context-Aware Alignment and Mutual Masking for 3D-Language Pre-Training,"3D visual language reasoning plays an important role in effective human-computer interaction. The current approaches for 3D visual reasoning are task-specific, and lack pre-training methods to learn generic representations that can transfer across various tasks. Despite the encouraging progress in vision-language pre-training for image-text data, 3D-language pre-training is still an open issue due to limited 3D-language paired data, highly sparse and irregular structure of point clouds and ambiguities in spatial relations of 3D objects with viewpoint changes. In this paper, we present a generic 3D-language pre-training approach, that tackles multiple facets of 3D-language reasoning by learning universal representations. Our learning objective constitutes two main parts. 1) Context aware spatial-semantic alignment to establish fine-grained correspondence between point clouds and texts. It reduces relational ambiguities by aligning 3D spatial relationships with textual semantic context. 2) Mutual 3D-Language Masked modeling to enable cross-modality information exchange. Instead of reconstructing sparse 3D points for which language can hardly provide cues, we propose masked proposal reasoning to learn semantic class and mask-invariant representations. Our proposed 3D-language pre-training method achieves promising results once adapted to various downstream tasks, including 3D visual grounding, 3D dense captioning and 3D question answering.

"Generalized Decoding for Pixel, Image, and Language","We present X-Decoder, a generalized decoding model that can predict pixel-level segmentation and language tokens seamlessly. X-Decoder takes as input two types of queries: (i) generic non-semantic queries and (ii) semantic queries induced from text inputs, to decode different pixel-level and token-level outputs in the same semantic space. With such a novel design, X-Decoder is the first work that provides a unified way to support all types of image segmentation and a variety of vision-language (VL) tasks. Further, our design enables seamless interactions across tasks at different granularities and brings mutual benefits by learning a common and rich pixel-level visual-semantic understanding space, without any pseudo-labeling. After pretraining on a mixed set of a limited amount of segmentation data and millions of image-text pairs, X-Decoder exhibits strong transferability to a wide range of downstream tasks in both zero-shot and finetuning settings. Notably, it achieves (1) state-of-the-art results on open-vocabulary segmentation and referring segmentation on eight datasets; (2) better or competitive finetuned performance to other generalist and specialist models on segmentation and VL tasks; and (3) flexibility for efficient finetuning and novel task composition.

Leveraging per Image-Token Consistency for Vision-Language Pre-Training,"Most existing vision-language pre-training (VLP) approaches adopt cross-modal masked language modeling (CMLM) to learn vision-language associations. However, we find that CMLM is insufficient for this purpose according to our observations: (1) Modality bias: a considerable amount of masked tokens in CMLM can be recovered with only the language information, ignoring the visual inputs. (2) Under-utilization of the unmasked tokens: CMLM primarily focuses on the masked token but it cannot simultaneously leverage other tokens to learn vision-language associations. To handle those limitations, we propose EPIC (lEveraging Per Image-Token Consistency for vision-language pre-training). In EPIC, for each image-sentence pair, we mask tokens that are salient to the image (i.e., Saliency-based Masking Strategy) and replace them with alternatives sampled from a language model (i.e., Inconsistent Token Generation Procedure), and then the model is required to determine for each token in the sentence whether it is consistent with the image (i.e., Image-Token Consistency Task). The proposed EPIC method is easily combined with pre-training methods. Extensive experiments show that the combination of the EPIC method and state-of-the-art pre-training approaches, including ViLT, ALBEF, METER, and X-VLM, leads to significant improvements on downstream tasks.

Learning Video Representations From Large Language Models,"We introduce LAVILA, a new approach to learning video-language representations by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). We repurpose pre-trained LLMs to be conditioned on visual input, and finetune them to create automatic video narrators. Our auto-generated narrations offer a number of advantages, including dense coverage of long videos, better temporal synchronization of the visual information and text, and much higher diversity of text. The video-language embedding learned contrastively with these narrations outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on multiple first-person and third-person video tasks, both in zero-shot and finetuned setups. Most notably, LAVILA obtains an absolute gain of 10.1% on EGTEA classification and 5.9% Epic-Kitchens-100 multi-instance retrieval benchmarks. Furthermore, LAVILA trained with only half the narrations from the Ego4D dataset outperforms models trained on the full set, and shows positive scaling behavior on increasing pre-training data and model size.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zhao_Learning_Video_Representations_From_Large_Language_Models_CVPR_2023_paper.html
MaskCLIP: Masked Self-Distillation Advances Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining,"This paper presents a simple yet effective framework MaskCLIP, which incorporates a newly proposed masked self-distillation into contrastive language-image pretraining. The core idea of masked self-distillation is to distill representation from a full image to the representation predicted from a masked image. Such incorporation enjoys two vital benefits. First, masked self-distillation targets local patch representation learning, which is complementary to vision-language contrastive focusing on text-related representation. Second, masked self-distillation is also consistent with vision-language contrastive from the perspective of training objective as both utilize the visual encoder for feature aligning, and thus is able to learn local semantics getting indirect supervision from the language. We provide specially designed experiments with a comprehensive analysis to validate the two benefits. Symmetrically, we also introduce the local semantic supervision into the text branch, which further improves the pretraining performance. With extensive experiments, we show that MaskCLIP, when applied to various challenging downstream tasks, achieves superior results in linear probing, finetuning, and zero-shot performance with the guidance of the language encoder. We will release the code and data after the publication.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Dong_MaskCLIP_Masked_Self-Distillation_Advances_Contrastive_Language-Image_Pretraining_CVPR_2023_paper.html
ShapeClipper: Scalable 3D Shape Learning From Single-View Images via Geometric and CLIP-Based Consistency,"We present ShapeClipper, a novel method that reconstructs 3D object shapes from real-world single-view RGB images. Instead of relying on laborious 3D, multi-view or camera pose annotation, ShapeClipper learns shape reconstruction from a set of single-view segmented images. The key idea is to facilitate shape learning via CLIP-based shape consistency, where we encourage objects with similar CLIP encodings to share similar shapes. We also leverage off-the-shelf normals as an additional geometric constraint so the model can learn better bottom-up reasoning of detailed surface geometry. These two novel consistency constraints, when used to regularize our model, improve its ability to learn both global shape structure and local geometric details. We evaluate our method over three challenging real-world datasets, Pix3D, Pascal3D+, and OpenImages, where we achieve superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Huang_ShapeClipper_Scalable_3D_Shape_Learning_From_Single-View_Images_via_Geometric_CVPR_2023_paper.html
MELTR: Meta Loss Transformer for Learning To Fine-Tune Video Foundation Models,"Foundation models have shown outstanding performance and generalization capabilities across domains. Since most studies on foundation models mainly focus on the pretraining phase, a naive strategy to minimize a single task-specific loss is adopted for fine-tuning. However, such fine-tuning methods do not fully leverage other losses that are potentially beneficial for the target task. Therefore, we propose MEta Loss TRansformer (MELTR), a plug-in module that automatically and non-linearly combines various loss functions to aid learning the target task via auxiliary learning. We formulate the auxiliary learning as a bi-level optimization problem and present an efficient optimization algorithm based on Approximate Implicit Differentiation (AID). For evaluation, we apply our framework to various video foundation models (UniVL, Violet and All-in-one), and show significant performance gain on all four downstream tasks: text-to-video retrieval, video question answering, video captioning, and multi-modal sentiment analysis. Our qualitative analyses demonstrate that MELTR adequately 'transforms' individual loss functions and 'melts' them into an effective unified loss.

Fake It Till You Make It: Learning Transferable Representations From Synthetic ImageNet Clones,"Recent image generation models such as Stable Diffusion have exhibited an impressive ability to generate fairly realistic images starting from a simple text prompt. Could such models render real images obsolete for training image prediction models? In this paper, we answer part of this provocative question by investigating the need for real images when training models for ImageNet classification. Provided only with the class names that have been used to build the dataset, we explore the ability of Stable Diffusion to generate synthetic clones of ImageNet and measure how useful these are for training classification models from scratch. We show that with minimal and class-agnostic prompt engineering, ImageNet clones are able to close a large part of the gap between models produced by synthetic images and models trained with real images, for the several standard classification benchmarks that we consider in this study. More importantly, we show that models trained on synthetic images exhibit strong generalization properties and perform on par with models trained on real data for transfer.

GIVL: Improving Geographical Inclusivity of Vision-Language Models With Pre-Training Methods,"A key goal for the advancement of AI is to develop technologies that serve the needs not just of one group but of all communities regardless of their geographical region. In fact, a significant proportion of knowledge is locally shared by people from certain regions but may not apply equally in other regions because of cultural differences. If a model is unaware of regional characteristics, it may lead to performance disparity across regions and result in bias against underrepresented groups. We propose GIVL, a Geographically Inclusive Vision-and-Language Pre-trained model. There are two attributes of geo-diverse visual concepts which can help to learn geo-diverse knowledge: 1) concepts under similar categories have unique knowledge and visual characteristics, 2) concepts with similar visual features may fall in completely different categories. Motivated by the attributes, we design new pre-training objectives Image-Knowledge Matching (IKM) and Image Edit Checking (IEC) to pre-train GIVL. Compared with similar-size models pre-trained with similar scale of data, GIVL achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) and more balanced performance on geo-diverse V&L tasks.

Mask-Free OVIS: Open-Vocabulary Instance Segmentation Without Manual Mask Annotations,"Existing instance segmentation models learn task-specific information using manual mask annotations from base (training) categories. These mask annotations require tremendous human effort, limiting the scalability to annotate novel (new) categories. To alleviate this problem, Open-Vocabulary (OV) methods leverage large-scale image-caption pairs and vision-language models to learn novel categories. In summary, an OV method learns task-specific information using strong supervision from base annotations and novel category information using weak supervision from image-captions pairs. This difference between strong and weak supervision leads to overfitting on base categories, resulting in poor generalization towards novel categories. In this work, we overcome this issue by learning both base and novel categories from pseudo-mask annotations generated by the vision-language model in a weakly supervised manner using our proposed Mask-free OVIS pipeline. Our method automatically generates pseudo-mask annotations by leveraging the localization ability of a pre-trained vision-language model for objects present in image-caption pairs. The generated pseudo-mask annotations are then used to supervise an instance segmentation model, freeing the entire pipeline from any labour-expensive instance-level annotations and overfitting. Our extensive experiments show that our method trained with just pseudo-masks significantly improves the mAP scores on the MS-COCO dataset and OpenImages dataset compared to the recent state-of-the-art methods trained with manual masks. Codes and models are provided in https://vibashan.github.io/ovis-web/.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/VS_Mask-Free_OVIS_Open-Vocabulary_Instance_Segmentation_Without_Manual_Mask_Annotations_CVPR_2023_paper.html
CLIP-S4: Language-Guided Self-Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Existing semantic segmentation approaches are often limited by costly pixel-wise annotations and predefined classes. In this work, we present CLIP-S^4 that leverages self-supervised pixel representation learning and vision-language models to enable various semantic segmentation tasks (e.g., unsupervised, transfer learning, language-driven segmentation) without any human annotations and unknown class information. We first learn pixel embeddings with pixel-segment contrastive learning from different augmented views of images. To further improve the pixel embeddings and enable language-driven semantic segmentation, we design two types of consistency guided by vision-language models: 1) embedding consistency, aligning our pixel embeddings to the joint feature space of a pre-trained vision-language model, CLIP; and 2) semantic consistency, forcing our model to make the same predictions as CLIP over a set of carefully designed target classes with both known and unknown prototypes. Thus, CLIP-S^4 enables a new task of class-free semantic segmentation where no unknown class information is needed during training. As a result, our approach shows consistent and substantial performance improvement over four popular benchmarks compared with the state-of-the-art unsupervised and language-driven semantic segmentation methods. More importantly, our method outperforms these methods on unknown class recognition by a large margin.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/He_CLIP-S4_Language-Guided_Self-Supervised_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Revisiting Multimodal Representation in Contrastive Learning: From Patch and Token Embeddings to Finite Discrete Tokens,"Contrastive learning-based vision-language pre-training approaches, such as CLIP, have demonstrated great success in many vision-language tasks. These methods achieve cross-modal alignment by encoding a matched image-text pair with similar feature embeddings, which are generated by aggregating information from visual patches and language tokens. However, direct aligning cross-modal information using such representations is challenging, as visual patches and text tokens differ in semantic levels and granularities. To alleviate this issue, we propose a Finite Discrete Tokens (FDT) based multimodal representation. FDT is a set of learnable tokens representing certain visual-semantic concepts. Both images and texts are embedded using shared FDT by first grounding multimodal inputs to FDT space and then aggregating the activated FDT representations. The matched visual and semantic concepts are enforced to be represented by the same set of discrete tokens by a sparse activation constraint. As a result, the granularity gap between the two modalities is reduced. Through both quantitative and qualitative analyses, we demonstrate that using FDT representations in CLIP-style models improves cross-modal alignment and performance in visual recognition and vision-language downstream tasks. Furthermore, we show that our method can learn more comprehensive representations, and the learned FDT capture meaningful cross-modal correspondence, ranging from objects to actions and attributes.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Chen_Revisiting_Multimodal_Representation_in_Contrastive_Learning_From_Patch_and_Token_CVPR_2023_paper.html
REVEAL: Retrieval-Augmented Visual-Language Pre-Training With Multi-Source Multimodal Knowledge Memory,"In this paper, we propose an end-to-end Retrieval-Augmented Visual Language Model (REVEAL) that learns to encode world knowledge into a large-scale memory, and to retrieve from it to answer knowledge-intensive queries. REVEAL consists of four key components: the memory, the encoder, the retriever and the generator. The large-scale memory encodes various sources of multimodal world knowledge (e.g. image-text pairs, question answering pairs, knowledge graph triplets, etc.) via a unified encoder. The retriever finds the most relevant knowledge entries in the memory, and the generator fuses the retrieved knowledge with the input query to produce the output. A key novelty in our approach is that the memory, encoder, retriever and generator are all pre-trained end-to-end on a massive amount of data. Furthermore, our approach can use a diverse set of multimodal knowledge sources, which is shown to result in significant gains. We show that REVEAL achieves state-of-the-art results on visual question answering and image captioning.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Hu_REVEAL_Retrieval-Augmented_Visual-Language_Pre-Training_With_Multi-Source_Multimodal_Knowledge_Memory_CVPR_2023_paper.html
CLIP2: Contrastive Language-Image-Point Pretraining From Real-World Point Cloud Data,"Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training, benefiting from large-scale unlabeled text-image pairs, has demonstrated great performance in open-world vision understanding tasks. However, due to the limited Text-3D data pairs, adapting the success of 2D Vision-Language Models (VLM) to the 3D space remains an open problem. Existing works that leverage VLM for 3D understanding generally resort to constructing intermediate 2D representations for the 3D data, but at the cost of losing 3D geometry information. To take a step toward open-world 3D vision understanding, we propose Contrastive Language-Image-Point Cloud Pretraining (CLIP^2) to directly learn the transferable 3D point cloud representation in realistic scenarios with a novel proxy alignment mechanism. Specifically, we exploit naturally-existed correspondences in 2D and 3D scenarios, and build well-aligned and instance-based text-image-point proxies from those complex scenarios. On top of that, we propose a cross-modal contrastive objective to learn semantic and instance-level aligned point cloud representation. Experimental results on both indoor and outdoor scenarios show that our learned 3D representation has great transfer ability in downstream tasks, including zero-shot and few-shot 3D recognition, which boosts the state-of-the-art methods by large margins. Furthermore, we provide analyses of the capability of different representations in real scenarios and present the optional ensemble scheme.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zeng_CLIP2_Contrastive_Language-Image-Point_Pretraining_From_Real-World_Point_Cloud_Data_CVPR_2023_paper.html
CLIPPO: Image-and-Language Understanding From Pixels Only,"Multimodal models are becoming increasingly effective, in part due to unified components, such as the Transformer architecture. However, multimodal models still often consist of many task- and modality-specific pieces and training procedures. For example, CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) trains independent text and image towers via a contrastive loss. We explore an additional unification: the use of a pure pixel-based model to perform image, text, and multimodal tasks. Our model is trained with contrastive loss alone, so we call it CLIP-Pixels Only (CLIPPO). CLIPPO uses a single encoder that processes both regular images and text rendered as images. CLIPPO performs image-based tasks such as retrieval and zero-shot image classification almost as well as CLIP-style models, with half the number of parameters and no text-specific tower or embedding. When trained jointly via image-text contrastive learning and next-sentence contrastive learning, CLIPPO can perform well on natural language understanding tasks, without any word-level loss (language modelling or masked language modelling), outperforming pixel-based prior work. Surprisingly, CLIPPO can obtain good accuracy in visual question answering, simply by rendering the question and image together. Finally, we exploit the fact that CLIPPO does not require a tokenizer to show that it can achieve strong performance on multilingual multimodal retrieval without modifications. Code and pretrained models are available at https://github.com/google-research/big_vision.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Tschannen_CLIPPO_Image-and-Language_Understanding_From_Pixels_Only_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Towards Universal Fake Image Detectors That Generalize Across Generative Models,"With generative models proliferating at a rapid rate, there is a growing need for general purpose fake image detectors. In this work, we first show that the existing paradigm, which consists of training a deep network for real-vs-fake classification, fails to detect fake images from newer breeds of generative models when trained to detect GAN fake images. Upon analysis, we find that the resulting classifier is asymmetrically tuned to detect patterns that make an image fake. The real class becomes a 'sink' class holding anything that is not fake, including generated images from models not accessible during training. Building upon this discovery, we propose to perform real-vs-fake classification without learning; i.e., using a feature space not explicitly trained to distinguish real from fake images. We use nearest neighbor and linear probing as instantiations of this idea. When given access to the feature space of a large pretrained vision-language model, the very simple baseline of nearest neighbor classification has surprisingly good generalization ability in detecting fake images from a wide variety of generative models; e.g., it improves upon the SoTA by +15.07 mAP and +25.90% acc when tested on unseen diffusion and autoregressive models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Ojha_Towards_Universal_Fake_Image_Detectors_That_Generalize_Across_Generative_Models_CVPR_2023_paper.html
DATID-3D: Diversity-Preserved Domain Adaptation Using Text-to-Image Diffusion for 3D Generative Model,"Recent 3D generative models have achieved remarkable performance in synthesizing high resolution photorealistic images with view consistency and detailed 3D shapes, but training them for diverse domains is challenging since it requires massive training images and their camera distribution information. Text-guided domain adaptation methods have shown impressive performance on converting the 2D generative model on one domain into the models on other domains with different styles by leveraging the CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training), rather than collecting massive datasets for those domains. However, one drawback of them is that the sample diversity in the original generative model is not well-preserved in the domain-adapted generative models due to the deterministic nature of the CLIP text encoder. Text-guided domain adaptation will be even more challenging for 3D generative models not only because of catastrophic diversity loss, but also because of inferior text-image correspondence and poor image quality. Here we propose DATID-3D, a domain adaptation method tailored for 3D generative models using text-to-image diffusion models that can synthesize diverse images per text prompt without collecting additional images and camera information for the target domain. Unlike 3D extensions of prior text-guided domain adaptation methods, our novel pipeline was able to fine-tune the state-of-the-art 3D generator of the source domain to synthesize high resolution, multi-view consistent images in text-guided targeted domains without additional data, outperforming the existing text-guided domain adaptation methods in diversity and text-image correspondence. Furthermore, we propose and demonstrate diverse 3D image manipulations such as one-shot instance-selected adaptation and single-view manipulated 3D reconstruction to fully enjoy diversity in text.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Kim_DATID-3D_Diversity-Preserved_Domain_Adaptation_Using_Text-to-Image_Diffusion_for_3D_Generative_CVPR_2023_paper.html
CrowdCLIP: Unsupervised Crowd Counting via Vision-Language Model,"Supervised crowd counting relies heavily on costly manual labeling, which is difficult and expensive, especially in dense scenes. To alleviate the problem, we propose a novel unsupervised framework for crowd counting, named CrowdCLIP. The core idea is built on two observations: 1) the recent contrastive pre-trained vision-language model (CLIP) has presented impressive performance on various downstream tasks; 2) there is a natural mapping between crowd patches and count text. To the best of our knowledge, CrowdCLIP is the first to investigate the vision-language knowledge to solve the counting problem. Specifically, in the training stage, we exploit the multi-modal ranking loss by constructing ranking text prompts to match the size-sorted crowd patches to guide the image encoder learning. In the testing stage, to deal with the diversity of image patches, we propose a simple yet effective progressive filtering strategy to first select the highly potential crowd patches and then map them into the language space with various counting intervals. Extensive experiments on five challenging datasets demonstrate that the proposed CrowdCLIP achieves superior performance compared to previous unsupervised state-of-the-art counting methods. Notably, CrowdCLIP even surpasses some popular fully-supervised methods under the cross-dataset setting.

iCLIP: Bridging Image Classification and Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training for Visual Recognition,"This paper presents a method that effectively combines two prevalent visual recognition methods, i.e., image classification and contrastive language-image pre-training, dubbed iCLIP. Instead of naive multi-task learning that use two separate heads for each task, we fuse the two tasks in a deep fashion that adapts the image classification to share the same formula and the same model weights with the language-image pre-training. To further bridge these two tasks, we propose to enhance the category names in image classification tasks using external knowledge, such as their descriptions in dictionaries. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method combines the advantages of two tasks well: the strong discrimination ability in image classification tasks due to the clear and clean category labels, and the good zero-shot ability in CLIP tasks ascribed to the richer semantics in the text descriptions. In particular, it reaches 82.9% top-1 accuracy on IN-1K, and surpasses CLIPby 1.8%, with similar model size, on zero-shot recognition of Kornblith 12-dataset benchmark. The code and models are publicly available at https://github.com/weiyx16/iCLIP.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wei_iCLIP_Bridging_Image_Classification_and_Contrastive_Language-Image_Pre-Training_for_Visual_CVPR_2023_paper.html
CapDet: Unifying Dense Captioning and Open-World Detection Pretraining,"Benefiting from large-scale vision-language pre-training on image-text pairs, open-world detection methods have shown superior generalization ability under the zero-shot or few-shot detection settings. However, a pre-defined category space is still required during the inference stage of existing methods and only the objects belonging to that space will be predicted. To introduce a ""real"" open-world detector, in this paper, we propose a novel method named CapDet to either predict under a given category list or directly generate the category of predicted bounding boxes. Specifically, we unify the open-world detection and dense caption tasks into a single yet effective framework by introducing an additional dense captioning head to generate the region-grounded captions. Besides, adding the captioning task will in turn benefit the generalization of detection performance since the captioning dataset covers more concepts. Experiment results show that by unifying the dense caption task, our CapDet has obtained significant performance improvements (e.g., +2.1% mAP on LVIS rare classes) over the baseline method on LVIS (1203 classes). Besides, our CapDet also achieves state-of-the-art performance on dense captioning tasks, e.g., 15.44% mAP on VG V1.2 and 13.98% on the VG-COCO dataset.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Long_CapDet_Unifying_Dense_Captioning_and_Open-World_Detection_Pretraining_CVPR_2023_paper.html
RILS: Masked Visual Reconstruction in Language Semantic Space,"Both masked image modeling (MIM) and natural language supervision have facilitated the progress of transferable visual pre-training. In this work, we seek the synergy between two paradigms and study the emerging properties when MIM meets natural language supervision. To this end, we present a novel masked visual Reconstruction In Language semantic Space (RILS) pre-training framework, in which sentence representations, encoded by the text encoder, serve as prototypes to transform the vision-only signals into patch-sentence probabilities as semantically meaningful MIM reconstruction targets. The vision models can therefore capture useful components with structured information by predicting proper semantic of masked tokens. Better visual representations could, in turn, improve the text encoder via the image-text alignment objective, which is essential for the effective MIM target transformation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method not only enjoys the best of previous MIM and CLIP but also achieves further improvements on various tasks due to their mutual benefits. RILS exhibits advanced transferability on downstream classification, detection, and segmentation, especially for low-shot regimes. Code is available at https://github.com/hustvl/RILS.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yang_RILS_Masked_Visual_Reconstruction_in_Language_Semantic_Space_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning Visual Representations via Language-Guided Sampling,"Although an object may appear in numerous contexts, we often describe it in a limited number of ways. Language allows us to abstract away visual variation to represent and communicate concepts. Building on this intuition, we propose an alternative approach to visual representation learning: using language similarity to sample semantically similar image pairs for contrastive learning. Our approach diverges from image-based contrastive learning by sampling view pairs using language similarity instead of hand-crafted augmentations or learned clusters. Our approach also differs from image-text contrastive learning by relying on pre-trained language models to guide the learning rather than directly minimizing a cross-modal loss. Through a series of experiments, we show that language-guided learning yields better features than image-based and image-text representation learning approaches.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Banani_Learning_Visual_Representations_via_Language-Guided_Sampling_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Understanding and Improving Visual Prompting: A Label-Mapping Perspective,"We revisit and advance visual prompting (VP), an input prompting technique for vision tasks. VP can reprogram a fixed, pre-trained source model to accomplish downstream tasks in the target domain by simply incorporating universal prompts (in terms of input perturbation patterns) into downstream data points. Yet, it remains elusive why VP stays effective even given a ruleless label mapping (LM) between the source classes and the target classes. Inspired by the above, we ask: How is LM interrelated with VP? And how to exploit such a relationship to improve its accuracy on target tasks? We peer into the influence of LM on VP and provide an affirmative answer that a better 'quality' of LM (assessed by mapping precision and explanation) can consistently improve the effectiveness of VP. This is in contrast to the prior art where the factor of LM was missing. To optimize LM, we propose a new VP framework, termed ILM-VP (iterative label mapping-based visual prompting), which automatically re-maps the source labels to the target labels and progressively improves the target task accuracy of VP. Further, when using a contrastive language-image pretrained (CLIP) model, we propose to integrate an LM process to assist the text prompt selection of CLIP and to improve the target task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposal significantly outperforms state-of-the-art VP methods. As highlighted below, we show that when reprogramming an ImageNet-pretrained ResNet-18 to 13 target tasks, our method outperforms baselines by a substantial margin, e.g., 7.9% and 6.7% accuracy improvements in transfer learning to the target Flowers102 and CIFAR100 datasets. Besides, our proposal on CLIP-based VP provides 13.7% and 7.1% accuracy improvements on Flowers102 and DTD respectively.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Chen_Understanding_and_Improving_Visual_Prompting_A_Label-Mapping_Perspective_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Towards Flexible Multi-Modal Document Models,"Creative workflows for generating graphical documents involve complex inter-related tasks, such as aligning elements, choosing appropriate fonts, or employing aesthetically harmonious colors. In this work, we attempt at building a holistic model that can jointly solve many different design tasks. Our model, which we denote by FlexDM, treats vector graphic documents as a set of multi-modal elements, and learns to predict masked fields such as element type, position, styling attributes, image, or text, using a unified architecture. Through the use of explicit multi-task learning and in-domain pre-training, our model can better capture the multi-modal relationships among the different document fields. Experimental results corroborate that our single FlexDM is able to successfully solve a multitude of different design tasks, while achieving performance that is competitive with task-specific and costly baselines.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Inoue_Towards_Flexible_Multi-Modal_Document_Models_CVPR_2023_paper.html
ScaleDet: A Scalable Multi-Dataset Object Detector,"Multi-dataset training provides a viable solution for exploiting heterogeneous large-scale datasets without extra annotation cost. In this work, we propose a scalable multi-dataset detector (ScaleDet) that can scale up its generalization across datasets when increasing the number of training datasets. Unlike existing multi-dataset learners that mostly rely on manual relabelling efforts or sophisticated optimizations to unify labels across datasets, we introduce a simple yet scalable formulation to derive a unified semantic label space for multi-dataset training. ScaleDet is trained by visual-textual alignment to learn the label assignment with label semantic similarities across datasets. Once trained, ScaleDet can generalize well on any given upstream and downstream datasets with seen and unseen classes. We conduct extensive experiments using LVIS, COCO, Objects365, OpenImages as upstream datasets, and 13 datasets from Object Detection in the Wild (ODinW) as downstream datasets. Our results show that ScaleDet achieves compelling strong model performance with an mAP of 50.7 on LVIS, 58.8 on COCO, 46.8 on Objects365, 76.2 on OpenImages, and 71.8 on ODinW, surpassing state-of-the-art detectors with the same backbone.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Chen_ScaleDet_A_Scalable_Multi-Dataset_Object_Detector_CVPR_2023_paper.html
MaPLe: Multi-Modal Prompt Learning,"Pre-trained vision-language (V-L) models such as CLIP have shown excellent generalization ability to downstream tasks. However, they are sensitive to the choice of input text prompts and require careful selection of prompt templates to perform well. Inspired by the Natural Language Processing (NLP) literature, recent CLIP adaptation approaches learn prompts as the textual inputs to fine-tune CLIP for downstream tasks. We note that using prompting to adapt representations in a single branch of CLIP (language or vision) is sub-optimal since it does not allow the flexibility to dynamically adjust both representation spaces on a downstream task. In this work, we propose Multi-modal Prompt Learning (MaPLe) for both vision and language branches to improve alignment between the vision and language representations. Our design promotes strong coupling between the vision-language prompts to ensure mutual synergy and discourages learning independent uni-modal solutions. Further, we learn separate prompts across different early stages to progressively model the stage-wise feature relationships to allow rich context learning. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach on three representative tasks of generalization to novel classes, new target datasets and unseen domain shifts. Compared with the state-of-the-art method Co-CoOp, MaPLe exhibits favorable performance and achieves an absolute gain of 3.45% on novel classes and 2.72% on overall harmonic-mean, averaged over 11 diverse image recognition datasets. Our code and pre-trained models are available at https://github.com/muzairkhattak/multimodal-prompt-learning.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Khattak_MaPLe_Multi-Modal_Prompt_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Multi-Modal Representation Learning With Text-Driven Soft Masks,"We propose a visual-linguistic representation learning approach within a self-supervised learning framework by introducing a new operation, loss, and data augmentation strategy. First, we generate diverse features for the image-text matching (ITM) task via soft-masking the regions in an image, which are most relevant to a certain word in the corresponding caption, instead of completely removing them. Since our framework relies only on image-caption pairs with no fine-grained annotations, we identify the relevant regions to each word by computing the word-conditional visual attention using multi-modal encoder. Second, we encourage the model to focus more on hard but diverse examples by proposing a focal loss for the image-text contrastive learning (ITC) objective, which alleviates the inherent limitations of overfitting and bias issues. Last, we perform multi-modal data augmentations for self-supervised learning via mining various examples by masking texts and rendering distortions on images. We show that the combination of these three innovations is effective for learning a pretrained model, leading to outstanding performance on multiple vision-language downstream tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Park_Multi-Modal_Representation_Learning_With_Text-Driven_Soft_Masks_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Scaling Language-Image Pre-Training via Masking,"We present Fast Language-Image Pre-training (FLIP), a simple and more efficient method for training CLIP. Our method randomly masks out and removes a large portion of image patches during training. Masking allows us to learn from more image-text pairs given the same wall-clock time and contrast more samples per iteration with similar memory footprint. It leads to a favorable trade-off between accuracy and training time. In our experiments on 400 million image-text pairs, FLIP improves both accuracy and speed over the no-masking baseline. On a large diversity of downstream tasks, FLIP dominantly outperforms the CLIP counterparts trained on the same data. Facilitated by the speedup, we explore the scaling behavior of increasing the model size, data size, or training length, and report encouraging results and comparisons. We hope that our work will foster future research on scaling vision-language learning.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Li_Scaling_Language-Image_Pre-Training_via_Masking_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Clover: Towards a Unified Video-Language Alignment and Fusion Model,"Building a universal video-language model for solving various video understanding tasks (e.g., text-video retrieval, video question answering) is an open challenge to the machine learning field. Towards this goal, most recent works build the model by stacking uni-modal and cross-modal feature encoders and train it with pair-wise contrastive pre-text tasks. Though offering attractive generality, the resulted models have to compromise between efficiency and performance. They mostly adopt different architectures to deal with different downstream tasks. We find this is because the pair-wise training cannot well align and fuse features from different modalities. We then introduce Clover--a Correlated Video-Language pre-training method--towards a universal video-language model for solving multiple video understanding tasks with neither performance nor efficiency compromise. It improves cross-modal feature alignment and fusion via a novel tri-modal alignment pre-training task. Additionally, we propose to enhance the tri-modal alignment via incorporating learning from semantic masked samples and a new pair-wise ranking loss. Clover establishes new state-of-the-arts on multiple downstream tasks, including three retrieval tasks for both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, and eight video question answering tasks. Codes and pre-trained models will be released at https://github.com/LeeYN-43/Clover.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Huang_Clover_Towards_a_Unified_Video-Language_Alignment_and_Fusion_Model_CVPR_2023_paper.html
DeAR: Debiasing Vision-Language Models With Additive Residuals,"Large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) reduce the time for developing predictive models for various vision-grounded language downstream tasks by providing rich, adaptable image and text representations. However, these models suffer from societal biases owing to the skewed distribution of various identity groups in the training data. These biases manifest as the skewed similarity between the representations for specific text concepts and images of people of different identity groups and, therefore, limit the usefulness of such models in real-world high-stakes applications. In this work, we present DeAR (Debiasing with Additive Residuals), a novel debiasing method that learns additive residual image representations to offset the original representations, ensuring fair output representations. In doing so, it reduces the ability of the representations to distinguish between the different identity groups. Further, we observe that the current fairness tests are performed on limited face image datasets that fail to indicate why a specific text concept should/should not apply to them. To bridge this gap and better evaluate DeAR, we introduce a new context-based bias benchmarking dataset - the Protected Attribute Tag Association (PATA) dataset for evaluating the fairness of large pre-trained VLMs. Additionally, PATA provides visual context for a diverse human population in different scenarios with both positive and negative connotations. Experimental results for fairness and zero-shot performance preservation using multiple datasets demonstrate the efficacy of our framework.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Seth_DeAR_Debiasing_Vision-Language_Models_With_Additive_Residuals_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Fine-Tuned CLIP Models Are Efficient Video Learners,"Large-scale multi-modal training with image-text pairs imparts strong generalization to CLIP model. Since training on a similar scale for videos is infeasible, recent approaches focus on the effective transfer of image-based CLIP to the video domain. In this pursuit, new parametric modules are added to learn temporal information and inter-frame relationships which require meticulous design efforts. Furthermore, when the resulting models are learned on videos, they tend to overfit on the given task distribution and lack in generalization aspect. This begs the following question: How to effectively transfer image-level CLIP representations to videos? In this work, we show that a simple Video Fine-tuned CLIP (ViFi-CLIP) baseline is generally sufficient to bridge the domain gap from images to videos. Our qualitative analysis illustrates that the frame-level processing from CLIP image-encoder followed by feature pooling and similarity matching with corresponding text embeddings helps in implicitly modeling the temporal cues within ViFi-CLIP. Such fine-tuning helps the model to focus on scene dynamics, moving objects and inter-object relationships. For low-data regimes where full fine-tuning is not viable, we propose a 'bridge and prompt' approach that first uses finetuning to bridge the domain gap and then learns prompts on language and vision side to adapt CLIP representations. We extensively evaluate this simple yet strong baseline on zero-shot, base-to-novel generalization, few-shot and fully supervised settings across five video benchmarks. Our code and models will be publicly released.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Rasheed_Fine-Tuned_CLIP_Models_Are_Efficient_Video_Learners_CVPR_2023_paper.html
MAP: Multimodal Uncertainty-Aware Vision-Language Pre-Training Model,"Multimodal semantic understanding often has to deal with uncertainty, which means the obtained messages tend to refer to multiple targets. Such uncertainty is problematic for our interpretation, including inter- and intra-modal uncertainty. Little effort has studied the modeling of this uncertainty, particularly in pre-training on unlabeled datasets and fine-tuning in task-specific downstream datasets. In this paper, we project the representations of all modalities as probabilistic distributions via a Probability Distribution Encoder (PDE) by utilizing sequence-level interactions. Compared to the exiting deterministic methods, such uncertainty modeling can convey richer multimodal semantic information and more complex relationships. Furthermore, we integrate uncertainty modeling with popular pre-training frameworks and propose suitable pre-training tasks: Distribution-based Vision-Language Contrastive learning (D-VLC), Distribution-based Masked Language Modeling (D-MLM), and Distribution-based Image-Text Matching (D-ITM). The fine-tuned models are applied to challenging downstream tasks, including image-text retrieval, visual question answering, visual reasoning, and visual entailment, and achieve state-of-the-art results.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Ji_MAP_Multimodal_Uncertainty-Aware_Vision-Language_Pre-Training_Model_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Probabilistic Prompt Learning for Dense Prediction,"Recent progress in deterministic prompt learning has become a promising alternative to various downstream vision tasks, enabling models to learn powerful visual representations with the help of pre-trained vision-language models. However, this approach results in limited performance for dense prediction tasks that require handling more complex and diverse objects, since a single and deterministic description cannot sufficiently represent the entire image. In this paper, we present a novel probabilistic prompt learning to fully exploit the vision-language knowledge in dense prediction tasks. First, we introduce learnable class-agnostic attribute prompts to describe universal attributes across the object class. The attributes are combined with class information and visual-context knowledge to define the class-specific textual distribution. Text representations are sampled and used to guide the dense prediction task using the probabilistic pixel-text matching loss, enhancing the stability and generalization capability of the proposed method. Extensive experiments on different dense prediction tasks and ablation studies demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Kwon_Probabilistic_Prompt_Learning_for_Dense_Prediction_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Exploring Intra-Class Variation Factors With Learnable Cluster Prompts for Semi-Supervised Image Synthesis,"Semi-supervised class-conditional image synthesis is typically performed by inferring and injecting class labels into a conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). The supervision in the form of class identity may be inadequate to model classes with diverse visual appearances. In this paper, we propose a Learnable Cluster Prompt-based GAN (LCP-GAN) to capture class-wise characteristics and intra-class variation factors with a broader source of supervision. To exploit partially labeled data, we perform soft partitioning on each class, and explore the possibility of associating intra-class clusters with learnable visual concepts in the feature space of a pre-trained language-vision model, e.g., CLIP. For class-conditional image generation, we design a cluster-conditional generator by injecting a combination of intra-class cluster label embeddings, and further incorporate a real-fake classification head on top of CLIP to distinguish real instances from the synthesized ones, conditioned on the learnable cluster prompts. This significantly strengthens the generator with more semantic language supervision. LCP-GAN not only possesses superior generation capability but also matches the performance of the fully supervised version of the base models: BigGAN and StyleGAN2-ADA, on multiple standard benchmarks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zhang_Exploring_Intra-Class_Variation_Factors_With_Learnable_Cluster_Prompts_for_Semi-Supervised_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Detection Hub: Unifying Object Detection Datasets via Query Adaptation on Language Embedding,"Combining multiple datasets enables performance boost on many computer vision tasks. But similar trend has not been witnessed in object detection when combining multiple datasets due to two inconsistencies among detection datasets: taxonomy difference and domain gap. In this paper, we address these challenges by a new design (named Detection Hub) that is dataset-aware and category-aligned. It not only mitigates the dataset inconsistency but also provides coherent guidance for the detector to learn across multiple datasets. In particular, the dataset-aware design is achieved by learning a dataset embedding that is used to adapt object queries as well as convolutional kernels in detection heads. The categories across datasets are semantically aligned into a unified space by replacing one-hot category representations with word embedding and leveraging the semantic coherence of language embedding. Detection Hub fulfills the benefits of large data on object detection. Experiments demonstrate that joint training on multiple datasets achieves significant performance gains over training on each dataset alone. Detection Hub further achieves SoTA performance on UODB benchmark with wide variety of datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Meng_Detection_Hub_Unifying_Object_Detection_Datasets_via_Query_Adaptation_on_CVPR_2023_paper.html
"Learning Geometric-Aware Properties in 2D Representation Using Lightweight CAD Models, or Zero Real 3D Pairs","Cross-modal training using 2D-3D paired datasets, such as those containing multi-view images and 3D scene scans, presents an effective way to enhance 2D scene understanding by introducing geometric and view-invariance priors into 2D features. However, the need for large-scale scene datasets can impede scalability and further improvements. This paper explores an alternative learning method by leveraging a lightweight and publicly available type of 3D data in the form of CAD models. We construct a 3D space with geometric-aware alignment where the similarity in this space reflects the geometric similarity of CAD models based on the Chamfer distance. The acquired geometric-aware properties are then induced into 2D features, which boost performance on downstream tasks more effectively than existing RGB-CAD approaches. Our technique is not limited to paired RGB-CAD datasets. By training exclusively on pseudo pairs generated from CAD-based reconstruction methods, we enhance the performance of SOTA 2D pre-trained models that use ResNet-50 or ViT-B backbones on various 2D understanding tasks. We also achieve comparable results to SOTA methods trained on scene scans on four tasks in NYUv2, SUNRGB-D, indoor ADE20k, and indoor/outdoor COCO, despite using lightweight CAD models or pseudo data.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Arsomngern_Learning_Geometric-Aware_Properties_in_2D_Representation_Using_Lightweight_CAD_Models_CVPR_2023_paper.html
PiMAE: Point Cloud and Image Interactive Masked Autoencoders for 3D Object Detection,"Masked Autoencoders learn strong visual representations and achieve state-of-the-art results in several independent modalities, yet very few works have addressed their capabilities in multi-modality settings. In this work, we focus on point cloud and RGB image data, two modalities that are often presented together in the real world and explore their meaningful interactions. To improve upon the cross-modal synergy in existing works, we propose PiMAE, a self-supervised pre-training framework that promotes 3D and 2D interaction through three aspects. Specifically, we first notice the importance of masking strategies between the two sources and utilize a projection module to complementarily align the mask and visible tokens of the two modalities. Then, we utilize a well-crafted two-branch MAE pipeline with a novel shared decoder to promote cross-modality interaction in the mask tokens. Finally, we design a unique cross-modal reconstruction module to enhance representation learning for both modalities. Through extensive experiments performed on large-scale RGB-D scene understanding benchmarks (SUN RGB-D and ScannetV2), we discover it is nontrivial to interactively learn point-image features, where we greatly improve multiple 3D detectors, 2D detectors and few-shot classifiers by 2.9%, 6.7%, and 2.4%, respectively.

Enhanced Multimodal Representation Learning With Cross-Modal KD,"This paper explores the tasks of leveraging auxiliary modalities which are only available at training to enhance multimodal representation learning through cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (KD). The widely adopted mutual information maximization-based objective leads to a short-cut solution of the weak teacher, i.e., achieving the maximum mutual information by simply making the teacher model as weak as the student model. To prevent such a weak solution, we introduce an additional objective term, i.e., the mutual information between the teacher and the auxiliary modality model. Besides, to narrow down the information gap between the student and teacher, we further propose to minimize the conditional entropy of the teacher given the student. Novel training schemes based on contrastive learning and adversarial learning are designed to optimize the mutual information and the conditional entropy, respectively. Experimental results on three popular multimodal benchmark datasets have shown that the proposed method outperforms a range of state-of-the-art approaches for video recognition, video retrieval and emotion classification.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Chen_Enhanced_Multimodal_Representation_Learning_With_Cross-Modal_KD_CVPR_2023_paper.html
ConStruct-VL: Data-Free Continual Structured VL Concepts Learning,"Recently, large-scale pre-trained Vision-and-Language (VL) foundation models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in many zero-shot downstream tasks, achieving competitive results for recognizing objects defined by as little as short text prompts. However, it has also been shown that VL models are still brittle in Structured VL Concept (SVLC) reasoning, such as the ability to recognize object attributes, states, and inter-object relations. This leads to reasoning mistakes, which need to be corrected as they occur by teaching VL models the missing SVLC skills; often this must be done using private data where the issue was found, which naturally leads to a data-free continual (no task-id) VL learning setting. In this work, we introduce the first Continual Data-Free Structured VL Concepts Learning (ConStruct-VL) benchmark and show it is challenging for many existing data-free CL strategies. We, therefore, propose a data-free method comprised of a new approach of Adversarial Pseudo-Replay (APR) which generates adversarial reminders of past tasks from past task models. To use this method efficiently, we also propose a continual parameter-efficient Layered-LoRA (LaLo) neural architecture allowing no-memory-cost access to all past models at train time. We show this approach outperforms all data-free methods by as much as   7% while even matching some levels of experience-replay (prohibitive for applications where data-privacy must be preserved).

Non-Contrastive Learning Meets Language-Image Pre-Training,"Contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) serves as a de-facto standard to align images and texts. Nonetheless, the loose correlation between images and texts of web-crawled data renders the contrastive objective data inefficient and craving for a large training batch size. In this work, we explore the validity of non-contrastive language-image pre-training (nCLIP) and study whether nice properties exhibited in visual self-supervised models can emerge. We empirically observe that the non-contrastive objective nourishes representation learning while sufficiently underperforming under zero-shot recognition. Based on the above study, we further introduce xCLIP, a multi-tasking framework combining CLIP and nCLIP, and show that nCLIP aids CLIP in enhancing feature semantics. The synergy between two objectives lets xCLIP enjoy the best of both worlds: superior performance in both zero-shot transfer and representation learning. Systematic evaluation is conducted spanning a wide variety of downstream tasks including zero-shot classification, out-of-domain classification, retrieval, visual representation learning, and textual representation learning, showcasing a consistent performance gain and validating the effectiveness of xCLIP.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zhou_Non-Contrastive_Learning_Meets_Language-Image_Pre-Training_CVPR_2023_paper.html
PLA: Language-Driven Open-Vocabulary 3D Scene Understanding,"Open-vocabulary scene understanding aims to localize and recognize unseen categories beyond the annotated label space. The recent breakthrough of 2D open-vocabulary perception is largely driven by Internet-scale paired image-text data with rich vocabulary concepts. However, this success cannot be directly transferred to 3D scenarios due to the inaccessibility of large-scale 3D-text pairs. To this end, we propose to distill knowledge encoded in pre-trained vision-language (VL) foundation models through captioning multi-view images from 3D, which allows explicitly associating 3D and semantic-rich captions. Further, to foster coarse-to-fine visual-semantic representation learning from captions, we design hierarchical 3D-caption pairs, leveraging geometric constraints between 3D scenes and multi-view images. Finally, by employing contrastive learning, the model learns language-aware embeddings that connect 3D and text for open-vocabulary tasks. Our method not only remarkably outperforms baseline methods by 25.8%   44.7% hIoU and 14.5%   50.4% hAP_ 50  in open-vocabulary semantic and instance segmentation, but also shows robust transferability on challenging zero-shot domain transfer tasks.

"CNVid-3.5M: Build, Filter, and Pre-Train the Large-Scale Public Chinese Video-Text Dataset","Owing to well-designed large-scale video-text datasets, recent years have witnessed tremendous progress in video-text pre-training. However, existing large-scale video-text datasets are mostly English-only. Though there are certain methods studying the Chinese video-text pre-training, they pre-train their models on private datasets whose videos and text are unavailable. This lack of large-scale public datasets and benchmarks in Chinese hampers the research and downstream applications of Chinese video-text pre-training. Towards this end, we release and benchmark CNVid-3.5M, a large-scale public cross-modal dataset containing over 3.5M Chinese video-text pairs. We summarize our contributions by three verbs, i.e., ""Build"", ""Filter"", and ""Pre-train"": 1) To build a public Chinese video-text dataset, we collect over 4.5M videos from the Chinese websites. 2) To improve the data quality, we propose a novel method to filter out 1M weakly-paired videos, resulting in the CNVid-3.5M dataset. And 3) we benchmark CNVid-3.5M with three mainstream pixel-level pre-training architectures. At last, we propose the Hard Sample Curriculum Learning strategy to promote the pre-training performance. To the best of our knowledge, CNVid-3.5M is the largest public video-text dataset in Chinese, and we provide the first pixel-level benchmarks for Chinese video-text pre-training.

HierVL: Learning Hierarchical Video-Language Embeddings,"Video-language embeddings are a promising avenue for injecting semantics into visual representations, but existing methods capture only short-term associations between seconds-long video clips and their accompanying text. We propose HierVL, a novel hierarchical video-language embedding that simultaneously accounts for both long-term and short-term associations. As training data, we take videos accompanied by timestamped text descriptions of human actions, together with a high-level text summary of the activity throughout the long video (as are available in Ego4D). We introduce a hierarchical contrastive training objective that encourages text-visual alignment at both the clip level and video level. While the clip-level constraints use the step-by-step descriptions to capture what is happening in that instant, the video-level constraints use the summary text to capture why it is happening, i.e., the broader context for the activity and the intent of the actor. Our hierarchical scheme yields a clip representation that outperforms its single-level counterpart, as well as a long-term video representation that achieves SotA results on tasks requiring long-term video modeling. HierVL successfully transfers to multiple challenging downstream tasks (in EPIC-KITCHENS-100, Charades-Ego, HowTo100M) in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Ashutosh_HierVL_Learning_Hierarchical_Video-Language_Embeddings_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Video-Text As Game Players: Hierarchical Banzhaf Interaction for Cross-Modal Representation Learning,"Contrastive learning-based video-language representation learning approaches, e.g., CLIP, have achieved outstanding performance, which pursue semantic interaction upon pre-defined video-text pairs. To clarify this coarse-grained global interaction and move a step further, we have to encounter challenging shell-breaking interactions for fine-grained cross-modal learning. In this paper, we creatively model video-text as game players with multivariate cooperative game theory to wisely handle the uncertainty during fine-grained semantic interaction with diverse granularity, flexible combination, and vague intensity. Concretely, we propose Hierarchical Banzhaf Interaction (HBI) to value possible correspondence between video frames and text words for sensitive and explainable cross-modal contrast. To efficiently realize the cooperative game of multiple video frames and multiple text words, the proposed method clusters the original video frames (text words) and computes the Banzhaf Interaction between the merged tokens. By stacking token merge modules, we achieve cooperative games at different semantic levels. Extensive experiments on commonly used text-video retrieval and video-question answering benchmarks with superior performances justify the efficacy of our HBI. More encouragingly, it can also serve as a visualization tool to promote the understanding of cross-modal interaction, which may have a far-reaching impact on the community.

KD-DLGAN: Data Limited Image Generation via Knowledge Distillation,"Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) rely heavily on large-scale training data for training high-quality image generation models. With limited training data, the GAN discriminator often suffers from severe overfitting which directly leads to degraded generation especially in generation diversity. Inspired by the recent advances in knowledge distillation (KD), we propose KD-GAN, a knowledge-distillation based generation framework that introduces pre-trained vision-language models for training effective data-limited image generation models. KD-GAN consists of two innovative designs. The first is aggregated generative KD that mitigates the discriminator overfitting by challenging the discriminator with harder learning tasks and distilling more generalizable knowledge from the pre-trained models. The second is correlated generative KD that improves the generation diversity by distilling and preserving the diverse image-text correlation within the pre-trained models. Extensive experiments over multiple benchmarks show that KD-GAN achieves superior image generation with limited training data. In addition, KD-GAN complements the state-of-the-art with consistent and substantial performance gains. Note that codes will be released.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Cui_KD-DLGAN_Data_Limited_Image_Generation_via_Knowledge_Distillation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Test of Time: Instilling Video-Language Models With a Sense of Time,"Modelling and understanding time remains a challenge in contemporary video understanding models. With language emerging as a key driver towards powerful generalization, it is imperative for foundational video-language models to have a sense of time. In this paper, we consider a specific aspect of temporal understanding: consistency of time order as elicited by before/after relations. We establish that seven existing video-language models struggle to understand even such simple temporal relations. We then question whether it is feasible to equip these foundational models with temporal awareness without re-training them from scratch. Towards this, we propose a temporal adaptation recipe on top of one such model, VideoCLIP, based on post-pretraining on a small amount of video-text data. We conduct a zero-shot evaluation of the adapted models on six datasets for three downstream tasks which require varying degrees of time awareness. We observe encouraging performance gains especially when the task needs higher time awareness. Our work serves as a first step towards probing and instilling a sense of time in existing video-language models without the need for data and compute-intense training from scratch.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Bagad_Test_of_Time_Instilling_Video-Language_Models_With_a_Sense_of_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation With Mask-Adapted CLIP,"Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment an image into semantic regions according to text descriptions, which may not have been seen during training. Recent two-stage methods first generate class-agnostic mask proposals and then leverage pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, to classify masked regions. We identify the performance bottleneck of this paradigm to be the pre-trained CLIP model, since it does not perform well on masked images. To address this, we propose to finetune CLIP on a collection of masked image regions and their corresponding text descriptions. We collect training data by mining an existing image-caption dataset (e.g., COCO Captions), using CLIP to match masked image regions to nouns in the image captions. Compared with the more precise and manually annotated segmentation labels with fixed classes (e.g., COCO-Stuff), we find our noisy but diverse dataset can better retain CLIP's generalization ability. Along with finetuning the entire model, we utilize the ""blank"" areas in masked images using a method we dub mask prompt tuning. Experiments demonstrate mask prompt tuning brings significant improvement without modifying any weights of CLIP, and it can further improve a fully finetuned model. In particular, when trained on COCO and evaluated on ADE20K-150, our best model achieves 29.6% mIoU, which is +8.5% higher than the previous state-of-the-art. For the first time, open-vocabulary generalist models match the performance of supervised specialist models in 2017 without dataset-specific adaptations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Liang_Open-Vocabulary_Semantic_Segmentation_With_Mask-Adapted_CLIP_CVPR_2023_paper.html
CLIP Is Also an Efficient Segmenter: A Text-Driven Approach for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,"Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) with image-level labels is a challenging task. Mainstream approaches follow a multi-stage framework and suffer from high training costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training models (CLIP) to localize different categories with only image-level labels and without further training. To efficiently generate high-quality segmentation masks from CLIP, we propose a novel WSSS framework called CLIP-ES. Our framework improves all three stages of WSSS with special designs for CLIP: 1) We introduce the softmax function into GradCAM and exploit the zero-shot ability of CLIP to suppress the confusion caused by non-target classes and backgrounds. Meanwhile, to take full advantage of CLIP, we re-explore text inputs under the WSSS setting and customize two text-driven strategies: sharpness-based prompt selection and synonym fusion. 2) To simplify the stage of CAM refinement, we propose a real-time class-aware attention-based affinity (CAA) module based on the inherent multi-head self-attention (MHSA) in CLIP-ViTs. 3) When training the final segmentation model with the masks generated by CLIP, we introduced a confidence-guided loss (CGL) focus on confident regions. Our CLIP-ES achieves SOTA performance on Pascal VOC 2012 and MS COCO 2014 while only taking 10% time of previous methods for the pseudo mask generation. Code is available at https://github.com/linyq2117/CLIP-ES.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Lin_CLIP_Is_Also_an_Efficient_Segmenter_A_Text-Driven_Approach_for_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning To Exploit Temporal Structure for Biomedical Vision-Language Processing,"Self-supervised learning in vision--language processing (VLP) exploits semantic alignment between imaging and text modalities. Prior work in biomedical VLP has mostly relied on the alignment of single image and report pairs even though clinical notes commonly refer to prior images. This does not only introduce poor alignment between the modalities but also a missed opportunity to exploit rich self-supervision through existing temporal content in the data. In this work, we explicitly account for prior images and reports when available during both training and fine-tuning. Our approach, named BioViL-T, uses a CNN--Transformer hybrid multi-image encoder trained jointly with a text model. It is designed to be versatile to arising challenges such as pose variations and missing input images across time. The resulting model excels on downstream tasks both in single- and multi-image setups, achieving state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on (I) progression classification, (II) phrase grounding, and (III) report generation, whilst offering consistent improvements on disease classification and sentence-similarity tasks. We release a novel multi-modal temporal benchmark dataset, CXR-T, to quantify the quality of vision--language representations in terms of temporal semantics. Our experimental results show the significant advantages of incorporating prior images and reports to make most use of the data.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Bannur_Learning_To_Exploit_Temporal_Structure_for_Biomedical_Vision-Language_Processing_CVPR_2023_paper.html
VindLU: A Recipe for Effective Video-and-Language Pretraining,"The last several years have witnessed remarkable progress in video-and-language (VidL) understanding. However, most modern VidL approaches use complex and specialized model architectures and sophisticated pretraining protocols, making the reproducibility, analysis and comparisons of these frameworks difficult. Hence, instead of proposing yet another new VidL model, this paper conducts a thorough empirical study demystifying the most important factors in the VidL model design. Among the factors that we investigate are (i) the spatiotemporal architecture design, (ii) the multimodal fusion schemes, (iii) the pretraining objectives, (iv) the choice of pretraining data, (v) pretraining and finetuning protocols, and (vi) dataset and model scaling. Our empirical study reveals that the most important design factors include: temporal modeling, video-to-text multimodal fusion, masked modeling objectives, and joint training on images and videos. Using these empirical insights, we then develop a step-by-step recipe, dubbed VindLU, for effective VidL pretraining. Our final model trained using our recipe achieves comparable or better than state-of-the-art results on several VidL tasks without relying on external CLIP pretraining. In particular, on the text-to-video retrieval task, our approach obtains 61.2% on DiDeMo, and 55.0% on ActivityNet, outperforming current SOTA by 7.8% and 6.1% respectively. Furthermore, our model also obtains state-of-the-art video question-answering results on ActivityNet-QA, MSRVTT-QA, MSRVTT-MC and TVQA. Our code and pretrained models are publicly available at: https://github.com/klauscc/VindLU.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Cheng_VindLU_A_Recipe_for_Effective_Video-and-Language_Pretraining_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Unified Visual Relationship Detection with Vision and Language Models,"This work focuses on training a single visual relationship detector predicting over the union of label spaces from multiple datasets. Merging labels spanning different datasets could be challenging due to inconsistent taxonomies. The issue is exacerbated in visual relationship detection when second-order visual semantics are introduced between pairs of objects. To address this challenge, we propose UniVRD, a novel bottom-up method for Unified Visual Relationship Detection by leveraging vision and language models (VLMs). VLMs provide well-aligned image and text embeddings, where similar relationships are optimized to be close to each other for semantic unification. Our bottom-up design enables the model to enjoy the benefit of training with both object detection and visual relationship datasets. Empirical results on both human-object interaction detection and scene-graph generation demonstrate the competitive performance of our model. UniVRD achieves 38.07 mAP on HICO-DET, outperforming the current best bottom-up HOI detector by 14.26 mAP. More importantly, we show that our unified detector performs as well as dataset-specific models in mAP, and achieves further improvements when we scale up the model. Our code will be made publicly available on GitHub.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhao_Unified_Visual_Relationship_Detection_with_Vision_and_Language_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
LD-ZNet: A Latent Diffusion Approach for Text-Based Image Segmentation,"Large-scale pre-training tasks like image classification, captioning, or self-supervised techniques do not incentivize learning the semantic boundaries of objects. However, recent generative foundation models built using text-based latent diffusion techniques may learn semantic boundaries. This is because they have to synthesize intricate details about all objects in an image based on a text description. Therefore, we present a technique for segmenting real and AI-generated images using latent diffusion models (LDMs) trained on internet-scale datasets. First, we show that the latent space of LDMs (z-space) is a better input representation compared to other feature representations like RGB images or CLIP encodings for text-based image segmentation. By training the segmentation models on the latent z-space, which creates a compressed representation across several domains like different forms of art, cartoons, illustrations, and photographs, we are also able to bridge the domain gap between real and AI-generated images. We show that the internal features of LDMs contain rich semantic information and present a technique in the form of LD-ZNet to further boost the performance of text-based segmentation. Overall, we show up to 6% improvement over standard baselines for text-to-image segmentation on natural images. For AI-generated imagery, we show close to 20% improvement compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

Chinese Text Recognition with A Pre-Trained CLIP-Like Model Through Image-IDS Aligning,"Scene text recognition has been studied for decades due to its broad applications. However, despite Chinese characters possessing different characteristics from Latin characters, such as complex inner structures and large categories, few methods have been proposed for Chinese Text Recognition (CTR). Particularly, the characteristic of large categories poses challenges in dealing with zero-shot and few-shot Chinese characters. In this paper, inspired by the way humans recognize Chinese texts, we propose a two-stage framework for CTR. Firstly, we pre-train a CLIP-like model through aligning printed character images and Ideographic Description Sequences (IDS). This pre-training stage simulates humans recognizing Chinese characters and obtains the canonical representation of each character. Subsequently, the learned representations are employed to supervise the CTR model, such that traditional single-character recognition can be improved to text-line recognition through image-IDS matching. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conduct extensive experiments on both Chinese character recognition (CCR) and CTR. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method performs best in CCR and outperforms previous methods in most scenarios of the CTR benchmark. It is worth noting that the proposed method can recognize zero-shot Chinese characters in text images without fine-tuning, whereas previous methods require fine-tuning when new classes appear. The code is available at https://github.com/FudanVI/FudanOCR/tree/main/image-ids-CTR.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Yu_Chinese_Text_Recognition_with_A_Pre-Trained_CLIP-Like_Model_Through_Image-IDS_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Sigmoid Loss for Language Image Pre-Training,"We propose a simple pairwise sigmoid loss for image-text pre-training. Unlike standard contrastive learning with softmax normalization, the sigmoid loss operates solely on image-text pairs and does not require a global view of the pairwise similarities for normalization. The sigmoid loss simultaneously allows further scaling up the batch size, while also performing better at smaller batch sizes. With only four TPUv4 chips, we can train a Base CLIP model at 4k batch size and a Large LiT model at 20k batch size, the latter achieves 84.5% ImageNet zero-shot accuracy in two days. This disentanglement of the batch size from the loss further allows us to study the impact of examples vs pairs and negative to positive ratio. Finally, we push the batch size to the extreme, up to one million, and find that the benefits of growing batch size quickly diminish, with a more reasonable batch size of 32k being sufficient. We hope our research motivates further explorations in improving the quality and efficiency of language-image pre-training.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhai_Sigmoid_Loss_for_Language_Image_Pre-Training_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Space-time Prompting for Video Class-incremental Learning,"Recently, prompt-based learning has made impressive progress on image class-incremental learning, but it still lacks sufficient exploration in the video domain. In this paper, we will fill this gap by learning multiple prompts based on a powerful image-language pre-trained model, i.e., CLIP, making it fit for video class-incremental learning (VCIL). For this purpose, we present a space-time prompting approach (ST-Prompt) which contains two kinds of prompts, i.e., task-specific prompts and task-agnostic prompts. The task-specific prompts are to address the catastrophic forgetting problem by learning multi-grained prompts, i.e., spatial prompts, temporal prompts and comprehensive prompts, for accurate task identification. The task-agnostic prompts maintain a globally-shared prompt pool, which can empower the pre-trained image models with temporal perception abilities by exchanging contexts between frames. By this means, ST-Prompt can transfer the plentiful knowledge in the image-language pre-trained models to the VCIL task with only a tiny set of prompts to be optimized. To evaluate ST-Prompt, we conduct extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks. The results show that ST-Prompt can significantly surpass the state-of-the-art VCIL methods, especially it gains 9.06% on HMDB51 dataset under the 1*25 stage setting.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Pei_Space-time_Prompting_for_Video_Class-incremental_Learning_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Open-domain Visual Entity Recognition: Towards Recognizing Millions of Wikipedia Entities,"Large-scale multi-modal pre-training models such as CLIP and PaLI exhibit strong generalization on various visual domains and tasks. However, existing image classification benchmarks often evaluate recognition on a specific domain (e.g., outdoor images) or a specific task (e.g., classifying plant species), which falls short of evaluating whether pre-trained foundational models are universal visual recognizers. To address this, we formally present the task of Open-domain Visual Entity recognitioN (OVEN), where a model need to link an image onto a Wikipedia entity with respect to a text query. We construct OVEN by re-purposing 14 existing datasets with all labels grounded onto one single label space: Wikipedia entities. OVEN challenges models to select among six million possible Wikipedia entities, making it a general visual recognition benchmark with largest number of labels. Our study on state-of-the-art pre-trained models reveals large headroom in generalizing to the massive-scale label space. We show that a PaLI-based auto-regressive visual recognition model performs surprisingly well, even on Wikipedia entities that have never been seen during fine-tuning. We also find existing pre-trained models yield different unique strengths: while PaLI-based models obtains higher overall performance, CLIP-based models are better at recognizing tail entities.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Hu_Open-domain_Visual_Entity_Recognition_Towards_Recognizing_Millions_of_Wikipedia_Entities_ICCV_2023_paper.html
MedKLIP: Medical Knowledge Enhanced Language-Image Pre-Training for X-ray Diagnosis,"In this paper, we consider enhancing medical visual-language pre-training (VLP) with domain-specific knowledge, by exploiting the paired image-text reports from the radiological daily practice. In particular, we make the following contributions: First, unlike existing works that directly process the raw reports, we adopt a novel triplet extraction module to extract the medical-related information, avoiding unnecessary complexity from language grammar and enhancing the supervision signals; Second, we propose a novel triplet encoding module with entity translation
 by querying a knowledge base, to exploit the rich domain knowledge in medical field, and implicitly build relationships between medical entities in the language embedding space; Third, we propose to use a Transformer-based fusion model for spatially aligning the entity description with visual signals at the image patch level, enabling the ability for medical diagnosis; Fourth, we conduct thorough experiments to validate the effectiveness of our architecture, and benchmark on numerous public benchmarks e.g., ChestX-ray14, RSNA Pneumonia, SIIM-ACR Pneumothorax, COVIDx CXR-2, COVID Rural, and EdemaSeverity. In both zero-shot and fine-tuning settings, our model has demonstrated strong performance compared with the former methods on disease classification and grounding.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wu_MedKLIP_Medical_Knowledge_Enhanced_Language-Image_Pre-Training_for_X-ray_Diagnosis_ICCV_2023_paper.html
ProbVLM: Probabilistic Adapter for Frozen Vison-Language Models,"Large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP successfully find correspondences between images and text. Through the standard deterministic mapping process, an image or a text sample is mapped to a single vector in the embedding space. This is problematic: as multiple samples (images or text) can abstract the same concept in the physical world, deterministic embeddings do not reflect the inherent ambiguity in the embedding space. We propose ProbVLM, a probabilistic adapter that estimates probability distributions for the embeddings of pre-trained VLMs via inter/intra-modal alignment in a post-hoc manner without needing large-scale datasets or computing. On four challenging datasets, i.e., COCO, Flickr, CUB, and Oxford-flowers, we estimate the multi-modal embedding uncertainties for two VLMs, i.e., CLIP and BLIP, quantify the calibration of embedding uncertainties in retrieval tasks and show that ProbVLM outperforms other methods. Furthermore, we propose active learning and model selection as two real-world downstream tasks for VLMs and show that the estimated uncertainty aids both tasks. Lastly, we present a novel technique for visualizing the embedding distributions using a large-scale pre-trained latent diffusion model.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Upadhyay_ProbVLM_Probabilistic_Adapter_for_Frozen_Vison-Language_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Equivariant Similarity for Vision-Language Foundation Models,"This study explores the concept of equivariance in vision-language foundation models (VLMs), focusing specifically on the multimodal similarity function that is not only the major training objective but also the core delivery to support downstream tasks. Unlike the existing image-text similarity objective which only categorizes matched pairs as similar and unmatched as dissimilar, equivariance also requires similarity to vary faithfully according to the semantic changes. This allows VLMs to generalize better to nuanced and unseen multimodal compositions. However, modeling equivariance is challenging as the ground truth of semantic change is difficult to collect. For example, given an image-text pair about a dog, it is unclear to what extent the similarity changes when the pixel is changed from dog to cat? To this end, we propose EqSim, a regularization loss that can be efficiently calculated from any two matched training pairs and easily pluggable into existing image-text retrieval fine-tuning. Meanwhile, to further diagnose the equivariance of VLMs, we present a new challenging benchmark EqBen. Compared to the existing evaluation sets, EqBen is the first to focus on ""visual-minimal change"". Extensive experiments show the lack of equivariance in current VLMs and validate the effectiveness of EqSim.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wang_Equivariant_Similarity_for_Vision-Language_Foundation_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Too Large; Data Reduction for Vision-Language Pre-Training,"This paper examines the problems of severe image-text misalignment and high redundancy in the widely-used large-scale Vision-Language Pre-Training (VLP) datasets. To address these issues, we propose an efficient and straightforward Vision-Language learning algorithm called TL;DR which aims to compress the existing large VLP data into a small, high-quality set. Our approach consists of two major steps. First, a codebook-based encoder-decoder captioner is developed to select representative samples. Second, a new caption is generated to complement the original captions for selected samples, mitigating the text-image misalignment problem while maintaining uniqueness. As the result, TL;DR enables us to reduce the large dataset into a small set of high-quality data, which can serve as an alternative pre-training dataset. This algorithm significantly speeds up the time-consuming pretraining process. Specifically, TL;DR can compress the mainstream VLP datasets at a high ratio, e.g., reduce well-cleaned CC3M dataset from 2.8M to 0.67M ( 24%) and noisy YFCC15M from 15M to 2.5M ( 16.7%). Extensive experiments with three popular VLP models over seven downstream tasks show that VLP model trained on the compressed dataset provided by TL;DR can perform similar or even better results compared with training on the full-scale dataset.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wang_Too_Large_Data_Reduction_for_Vision-Language_Pre-Training_ICCV_2023_paper.html
SCOB: Universal Text Understanding via Character-wise Supervised Contrastive Learning with Online Text Rendering for Bridging Domain Gap,"Inspired by the great success of language model (LM)-based pre-training, recent studies in visual document understanding have explored LM-based pre-training methods for modeling text within document images. Among them, pre-training that reads all text from an image has shown promise, but often exhibits instability and even fails when applied to broader domains, such as those involving both visual documents and scene text images. This is a substantial limitation for real-world scenarios, where the processing of text image inputs in diverse domains is essential. In this paper, we investigate effective pre-training tasks in the broader domains and also propose a novel pre-training method called SCOB that leverages character-wise supervised contrastive learning with online text rendering to effectively pre-train document and scene text domains by bridging the domain gap. Moreover, SCOB enables weakly supervised learning, significantly reducing annotation costs. Extensive benchmarks demonstrate that SCOB generally improves vanilla pre-training methods and achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods. Our findings suggest that SCOB can be served generally and effectively for read-type pre-training methods.

Semantify: Simplifying the Control of 3D Morphable Models Using CLIP,"We present Semantify: a self-supervised method that utilizes the semantic power of CLIP language-vision foundation model to simplify the control of 3D morphable models. Given a parametric model, training data is created by randomly sampling the model's parameters, creating various shapes and rendering them. The similarity between the output images and a set of word descriptors is calculated in CLIP's latent space. Our key idea is first to choose a small set of semantically meaningful and disentangled descriptors that characterize the 3DMM, and then learn a non-linear mapping from scores across this set to the parametric coefficients of the given 3DMM. The non-linear mapping is defined by training a neural network without a human-in-the-loop. We present results on numerous 3DMMs: body shape models, face shape and expression models, as well as animal shapes. We demonstrate how our method defines a simple slider interface for intuitive modeling, and show how the mapping can be used to instantly fit a 3D parametric body shape to in-the-wild images.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Gralnik_Semantify_Simplifying_the_Control_of_3D_Morphable_Models_Using_CLIP_ICCV_2023_paper.html
CLIP-Driven Universal Model for Organ Segmentation and Tumor Detection,"An increasing number of public datasets have shown a marked impact on automated organ segmentation and tumor detection. However, due to the small size and partially labeled problem of each dataset, as well as a limited investigation of diverse types of tumors, the resulting models are often limited to segmenting specific organs/tumors and ignore the semantics of anatomical structures, nor can they be extended to novel domains. 
 To address these issues, we propose the CLIP-Driven Universal Model, which incorporates text embedding learned from Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) to segmentation models. This CLIP-based label encoding captures anatomical relationships, enabling the model to learn a structured feature embedding and segment 25 organs and 6 types of tumors. The proposed model is developed from an assembly of 14 datasets, using a total of 3,410 CT scans for training and then evaluated on 6,162 external CT scans from 3 additional datasets. We rank first on the Medical Segmentation Decathlon (MSD) public leaderboard and achieve state-of-the-art results on Beyond The Cranial Vault (BTCV). Additionally, the Universal Model is computationally more efficient (6xfaster) compared with dataset-specific models, generalized better to CT scans from varying sites, and shows stronger transfer learning performance on novel tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Liu_CLIP-Driven_Universal_Model_for_Organ_Segmentation_and_Tumor_Detection_ICCV_2023_paper.html
BoMD: Bag of Multi-label Descriptors for Noisy Chest X-ray Classification,"Deep learning methods have shown outstanding classification accuracy in medical imaging problems, which is largely attributed to the availability of large-scale datasets manually annotated with clean labels. However, given the high cost of such manual annotation, new medical imaging classification problems may need to rely on machine-generated noisy labels extracted from radiology reports. Indeed, many Chest X-Ray (CXR) classifiers have been modelled from datasets with noisy labels, but their training procedure is in general not robust to noisy-label samples, leading to sub-optimal models. Furthermore, CXR datasets are mostly multi-label, so current multi-class noisy-label learning methods cannot be easily adapted. In this paper, we propose a new method designed for noisy multi-label CXR learning, which detects and smoothly re-labels noisy samples from the dataset to be used in the training of common multi-label classifiers. The proposed method optimises a bag of multi-label descriptors (BoMD) to promote their similarity with the semantic descriptors produced by language models from multi-label image annotations. Our experiments on noisy multi-label training sets and clean testing sets show that our model has state-of-the-art accuracy and robustness in many CXR multi-label classification benchmarks, including a new benchmark that we propose to systematically assess noisy multi-label methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Chen_BoMD_Bag_of_Multi-label_Descriptors_for_Noisy_Chest_X-ray_Classification_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Ponder: Point Cloud Pre-training via Neural Rendering,"We propose a novel approach to self-supervised learning of point cloud representations by differentiable neural rendering. Motivated by the fact that informative point cloud features should be able to encode rich geometry and appearance cues and render realistic images, we train a point-cloud encoder within a devised point-based neural renderer by comparing the rendered images with real images on massive RGB-D data. The learned point-cloud encoder can be easily integrated into various downstream tasks, including not only high-level tasks like 3D detection and segmentation, but low-level tasks like 3D reconstruction and image synthesis. Extensive experiments on various tasks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing pre-training methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Huang_Ponder_Point_Cloud_Pre-training_via_Neural_Rendering_ICCV_2023_paper.html
MasQCLIP for Open-Vocabulary Universal Image Segmentation,"We present a new method for open-vocabulary universal image segmentation, which is capable of performing instance, semantic, and panoptic segmentation under a unified framework. Our approach, called MasQCLIP, seamlessly integrates with a pre-trained CLIP model by utilizing its dense features, thereby circumventing the need for extensive parameter training. MasQCLIP emphasizes two new aspects when building an image segmentation method with a CLIP model: 1) a student-teacher module to deal with masks of the novel (unseen) classes by distilling information from the base (seen) classes; 2) a fine-tuning process to update model parameters for the queries Q within the CLIP model. Thanks to these two simple and intuitive designs, MasQCLIP is able to achieve state-of-the-art performances with a substantial gain over the competing methods by a large margin across all three tasks, including open-vocabulary instance, semantic, and panoptic segmentation.

TinyCLIP: CLIP Distillation via Affinity Mimicking and Weight Inheritance,"In this paper, we propose a novel cross-modal distillation method, called TinyCLIP, for large-scale language-image pre-trained models. The method introduces two core techniques: affinity mimicking and weight inheritance. Affinity mimicking explores the interaction between modalities during distillation, enabling student models to mimic teachers' behavior of learning cross-modal feature alignment in a visual-linguistic affinity space. Weight inheritance transmits the pre-trained weights from the teacher models to their student counterparts to improve distillation efficiency. Moreover, we extend the method into a multi-stage progressive distillation to mitigate the loss of informative weights during extreme compression. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of TinyCLIP, showing that it can reduce the size of the pre-trained CLIP ViT-B/32 by 50%, while maintaining comparable zero-shot performance. While aiming for comparable performance, distillation with weight inheritance can speed up the training by 1.4 - 7.8x compared to training from scratch. Moreover, our TinyCLIP ViT-8M/16, trained on YFCC-15M, achieves an impressive zero-shot top-1 accuracy of 41.1% on ImageNet, surpassing the original CLIP ViT-B/16 by 3.5% while utilizing only 8.9% parameters. Finally, we demonstrate the good transferability of TinyCLIP in various downstream tasks. Code and models will be open-sourced at aka.ms/tinyclip.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wu_TinyCLIP_CLIP_Distillation_via_Affinity_Mimicking_and_Weight_Inheritance_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Take-A-Photo: 3D-to-2D Generative Pre-training of Point Cloud Models,"With the overwhelming trend of mask image modeling led by MAE, generative pre-training has shown a remarkable potential to boost the performance of fundamental models in 2D vision. However, in 3D vision, the over-reliance on Transformer-based backbones and the unordered nature of point clouds have restricted the further development of gen- erative pre-training. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D-to- 2D generative pre-training method that is adaptable to any point cloud model. We propose to generate view images from different instructed poses via the cross-attention mechanism as the pre-training scheme. Generating view images has more precise supervision than its point cloud counterpart, thus assisting 3D backbones to have a finer comprehension of the geometrical structure and stereoscopic relations of the point cloud. Experimental results have proved the su- periority of our proposed 3D-to-2D generative pre-training over previous pre-training methods. Our method is also ef- fective in boosting the performance of architecture-oriented approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance when fine-tuning on ScanObjectNN classification and ShapeNet- Part segmentation tasks.

Open-vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation with Embedding Modulation,"Open-vocabulary segmentation is attracting increasing attention due to its critical applications in the real world. Traditional closed-vocabulary segmentation methods are not able to characterize novel objects, whereas several recent open-vocabulary attempts obtain unsatisfactory results, i.e., notable performance reduction on the closed-vocabulary and massive demand for extra training data. To this end, we propose OPSNet, an omnipotent and data-efficient framework for Open-vocabulary Panoptic Segmentation. Specifically, the exquisitely designed Embedding Modulation module, together with several meticulous components, enables adequate embedding enhancement and information exchange between the segmentation backbone and the visual-linguistic well-aligned CLIP encoder, resulting in superior segmentation performance under both open- and closed vocabulary settings and much fewer need of additional data. Extensive experimental evaluations are conducted across multiple datasets(e.g., COCO, ADE20K, Cityscapes, and PascalContext) under various circumstances, where the proposed OPSNet achieves state-of-the-art results, which demonstrates the effectiveness and generality of the proposed approach. The code and trained models will be made publicly available.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Chen_Open-vocabulary_Panoptic_Segmentation_with_Embedding_Modulation_ICCV_2023_paper.html
ALIP: Adaptive Language-Image Pre-Training with Synthetic Caption,"Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has significantly boosted the performance of various vision-language tasks by scaling up the dataset with image-text pairs collected from the web. However, the presence of intrinsic noise and unmatched image-text pairs in web data can potentially affect the performance of representation learning. To address this issue, we first utilize the OFA model to generate synthetic captions that focus on the image content. The generated captions contain complementary information that is beneficial for pre-training. Then, we propose an Adaptive Language-Image Pre-training (ALIP), a bi-path model that integrates supervision from both raw text and synthetic caption. As the core components of ALIP, the Language Consistency Gate (LCG) and Description Consistency Gate (DCG) dynamically adjust the weights of samples and image-text/caption pairs during the training process. Meanwhile, the adaptive contrastive loss can effectively reduce the impact of noise data and enhances the efficiency of pre-training data. We validate ALIP with experiments on different scales of models and pre-training datasets. Experiments results show that ALIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple downstream tasks including zero-shot image-text retrieval and linear probe. To facilitate future research, the code and pre-trained models are released at https://github.com/deepglint/ALIP.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Yang_ALIP_Adaptive_Language-Image_Pre-Training_with_Synthetic_Caption_ICCV_2023_paper.html
CLIP2Point: Transfer CLIP to Point Cloud Classification with Image-Depth Pre-Training,"Pre-training across 3D vision and language remains under development because of limited training data. Recent works attempt to transfer vision-language (V-L) pre-training methods to 3D vision. However, the domain gap between 3D and images is unsolved, so that V-L pre-trained models are restricted in 3D downstream tasks. To address this issue, we propose CLIP2Point, an image-depth pre-training method by contrastive learning to transfer CLIP to the 3D domain, and adapt it to point cloud classification. We introduce a new depth rendering setting that forms a better visual effect, and then render 52,460 pairs of images and depth maps from ShapeNet for pre-training. The pre-training scheme of CLIP2Point combines cross-modality learning to enforce the depth features for capturing expressive visual and textual features and intra-modality learning to enhance the invariance of depth aggregation. Additionally, we propose a novel Gated Dual-Path Adapter (GDPA), i.e., a dual-path structure with global-view aggregators and gated fusion for downstream representative learning. It allows the ensemble of CLIP and CLIP2Point, tuning pre-training knowledge to downstream tasks in an efficient adaptation. Experimental results show that CLIP2Point is effective in transferring CLIP knowledge to 3D vision. Our CLIP2Point outperforms other 3D transfer learning and pre-training networks, achieving state-of-the-art results on zero-shot, few-shot, and fully-supervised classification.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Huang_CLIP2Point_Transfer_CLIP_to_Point_Cloud_Classification_with_Image-Depth_Pre-Training_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Global Knowledge Calibration for Fast Open-Vocabulary Segmentation,"Recent advancements in pre-trained vision-language models, such as CLIP, have enabled the segmentation of arbitrary concepts solely from textual inputs, a process commonly referred to as open-vocabulary semantic segmentation (OVS). However, existing OVS techniques confront a fundamental challenge: the trained classifier tends to overfit on the base classes observed during training, resulting in suboptimal generalization performance to unseen classes. To mitigate this issue, recent studies have proposed the use of an additional frozen pre-trained CLIP for classification. Nonetheless, this approach incurs heavy computational overheads as the CLIP vision encoder must be repeatedly forward-passed for each mask, rendering it impractical for real-world applications. To address this challenge, our objective is to develop a fast OVS model that can perform comparably or better without the extra computational burden of the CLIP image encoder during inference. To this end, we propose a core idea of preserving the generalizable representation when fine-tuning on known classes. Specifically, we introduce a text diversification strategy that generates a set of synonyms for each training category, which prevents the learned representation from collapsing onto specific known category names. Additionally, we employ a text-guided knowledge distillation method to preserve the generalizable knowledge of CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed model achieves robust generalization performance across various datasets. Furthermore, we perform a preliminary exploration of open-vocabulary video segmentation and present a benchmark that can facilitate future open-vocabulary research in the video domain.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Han_Global_Knowledge_Calibration_for_Fast_Open-Vocabulary_Segmentation_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Perceptual Grouping in Contrastive Vision-Language Models,"Recent advances in zero-shot image recognition suggest that vision-language models learn generic visual representations with a high degree of semantic information that may be arbitrarily probed with natural language phrases. Understanding an image, however, is not just about understanding what content resides within an image, but importantly, where that content resides. In this work we examine how well vision-language models are able to understand where objects reside within an image and group together visually related parts of the imagery. We demonstrate how contemporary vision and language representation learning models based on contrastive losses and large web-based data capture limited object localization information. We propose a minimal set of modifications that results in models that uniquely learn both semantic and spatial information. We measure this performance in terms of zero-shot image recognition, unsupervised bottom-up and top-down semantic segmentations, as well as robustness analyses. We find that the resulting model achieves state-of-the-art results in terms of unsupervised segmentation, and demonstrate that the learned representations are uniquely robust to spurious correlations in datasets designed to probe the causal behavior of vision models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Ranasinghe_Perceptual_Grouping_in_Contrastive_Vision-Language_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
PromptStyler: Prompt-driven Style Generation for Source-free Domain Generalization,"In a joint vision-language space, a text feature (e.g., from ""a photo of a dog"") could effectively represent its relevant image features (e.g., from dog photos). Also, a recent study has demonstrated the cross-modal transferability phenomenon of this joint space. From these observations, we propose PromptStyler which simulates various distribution shifts in the joint space by synthesizing diverse styles via prompts without using any images to deal with source-free domain generalization. The proposed method learns to generate a variety of style features (from ""a S* style of a"") via learnable style word vectors for pseudo-words S*. To ensure that learned styles do not distort content information, we force style-content features (from ""a S* style of a [class]"") to be located nearby their corresponding content features (from ""[class]"") in the joint vision-language space. After learning style word vectors, we train a linear classifier using synthesized style-content features. PromptStyler achieves the state of the art on PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DomainNet, even though it does not require any images for training.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Cho_PromptStyler_Prompt-driven_Style_Generation_for_Source-free_Domain_Generalization_ICCV_2023_paper.html
The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Large Language-Vision Models for Source-Free Video Domain Adaptation,"Source-Free Video Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (SFVUDA) task consists in adapting an action recognition model, trained on a labelled source dataset, to an unlabelled target dataset, without accessing the actual source data. The previous approaches have attempted to address SFVUDA by leveraging self-supervision (e.g., enforcing temporal consistency) derived from the target data itself. In this work, we take an orthogonal approach by exploiting ""web-supervision"" from Large Language-Vision Models (LLVMs), driven by the rationale that LLVMs contain a rich world prior surprisingly robust to domain-shift. We showcase the unreasonable effectiveness of integrating LLVMs for SFVUDA by devising an intuitive and parameter-efficient method, which we name Domain Adaptation with Large Language-Vision models (DALL-V), that distills the world prior and complementary source model information into a student network tailored for the target. Despite the simplicity, DALL-V achieves significant improvement over state-of-the-art SFVUDA methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zara_The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Large_Language-Vision_Models_for_Source-Free_Video_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Self-regulating Prompts: Foundational Model Adaptation without Forgetting,"Prompt learning has emerged as an efficient alternative for fine-tuning foundational models, such as CLIP, for various downstream tasks. Conventionally trained using the task-specific objective, i.e., cross-entropy loss, prompts tend to overfit downstream data distributions and find it challenging to capture task-agnostic general features from the frozen CLIP. This leads to the loss of the model's original generalization capability. To address this issue, our work introduces a self-regularization framework for prompting called PromptSRC (Prompting with Self-regulating Constraints). PromptSRC guides the prompts to optimize for both task-specific and task-agnostic general representations using a three-pronged approach by: (a) regulating prompted representations via mutual agreement maximization with the frozen model, (b) regulating with self-ensemble of prompts over the training trajectory to encode their complementary strengths, and (c) regulating with textual diversity to mitigate sample diversity imbalance with the visual branch. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first regularization framework for prompt learning that avoids overfitting by jointly attending to pre-trained model features, the training trajectory during prompting, and the textual diversity. PromptSRC explicitly steers the prompts to learn a representation space that maximizes performance on downstream tasks without compromising CLIP generalization. We perform extensive experiments on 4 benchmarks where PromptSRC overall performs favorably well compared to the existing methods. Our code and pre-trained models are publicly available.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Khattak_Self-regulating_Prompts_Foundational_Model_Adaptation_without_Forgetting_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Contrastive Feature Masking Open-Vocabulary Vision Transformer,"We present Contrastive Feature Masking Vision Transformer (CFM-ViT) - an image-text pretraining methodology that achieves simultaneous learning of image- and region level representation for open-vocabulary object detection (OVD). Our approach combines the masked autoencoder (MAE) objective into the contrastive learning objective to improve the representation for localization tasks. Unlike standard MAE, we perform reconstruction in the joint image-text embedding space, rather than the pixel space as is customary with the classical MAE method, which causes the model to better learn region-level semantics. Moreover, we introduce Positional Embedding Dropout (PED) to address scale variation between image-text pretraining and detection finetuning by randomly dropping out the positional embeddings during pretraining. PED improves detection performance and enables the use of a frozen ViT backbone as a region classifier, preventing the forgetting of open-vocabulary knowledge during detection finetuning. On LVIS open-vocabulary detection benchmark, CFM-ViT achieves a state-of-the-art 33.9 APr, surpassing the best approach by 7.6 points and achieves better zero-shot detection transfer. Finally, CFM-ViT acquires strong image-level representation, outperforming the state of the art on 8 out of 12 metrics on zero-shot image-text retrieval benchmarks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Kim_Contrastive_Feature_Masking_Open-Vocabulary_Vision_Transformer_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Learning from Semantic Alignment between Unpaired Multiviews for Egocentric Video Recognition,"We are concerned with a challenging scenario in unpaired multiview video learning. In this case, the model aims to learn comprehensive multiview representations while the cross-view semantic information exhibits variations. We propose Semantics-based Unpaired Multiview Learning (SUM-L) to tackle this unpaired multiview learning problem. The key idea is to build cross-view pseudo-pairs and do view-invariant alignment by leveraging the semantic information of videos. To facilitate the data efficiency of multiview learning, we further perform video-text alignment for first-person and third-person videos, to fully leverage the semantic knowledge to improve video representations. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our framework. Our method also outperforms multiple existing view-alignment methods, under the more challenging scenario than typical paired or unpaired multimodal or multiview learning. Our code is available at https://github.com/wqtwjt1996/SUM-L.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wang_Learning_from_Semantic_Alignment_between_Unpaired_Multiviews_for_Egocentric_Video_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Exploring Temporal Concurrency for Video-Language Representation Learning,"Paired video and language data is naturally temporal concurrency, which requires the modeling of the temporal dynamics within each modality and the temporal alignment across modalities simultaneously. However, most existing video-language representation learning methods only focus on discrete semantic alignment that encourages aligned semantics to be close in the latent space, or temporal context dependency that captures short-range coherence, failing in building the temporal concurrency. In this paper, we propose to learn video-language representations by modeling video-language pairs as Temporal Concurrent Processes (TCP) via a process-wised distance metric learning framework. Specifically, we employ the soft Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) to measure the distance between two processes across modalities and then optimize the DTW costs. Meanwhile, we further introduce a regularization term that enforces the embeddings of each modality approximating a stochastic process to guarantee the inherent dynamics. Experimental results on three benchmarks demonstrate that TCP stands as a state-of-the-art method for various video-language understanding tasks, including paragraph-to-video retrieval, video moment retrieval, and video question-answering. Code is available at https://github.com/hengRUC/TCP.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhang_Exploring_Temporal_Concurrency_for_Video-Language_Representation_Learning_ICCV_2023_paper.html
CTP:Towards Vision-Language Continual Pretraining via Compatible Momentum Contrast and Topology Preservation,"Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has shown impressive results on diverse downstream tasks by offline training on large-scale datasets. Regarding the growing nature of real-world data, such an offline training paradigm on ever-expanding data is unsustainable, because models lack the continual learning ability to accumulate knowledge constantly. However, most continual learning studies are limited to uni-modal classification and existing multi-modal datasets cannot simulate continual non-stationary data stream scenarios. To support the study of Vision-Language Continual Pretraining (VLCP), we first contribute a comprehensive and unified benchmark dataset P9D which contains over one million product image-text pairs from 9 industries. The data from each industry as an independent task supports continual learning and conforms to the real-world long-tail nature to simulate pretraining on web data. We comprehensively study the characteristics and challenges of VLCP, and propose a new algorithm: Compatible momentum contrast with Topology Preservation, dubbed CTP. The compatible momentum model absorbs the knowledge of the current and previous-task models to flexibly update the modal feature. Moreover, Topology Preservation transfers the knowledge of embedding across tasks while preserving the flexibility of feature adjustment. The experimental results demonstrate our method not only achieves superior performance compared with other baselines but also does not bring an expensive training burden.

FLIP: Cross-domain Face Anti-spoofing with Language Guidance,"Face anti-spoofing (FAS) or presentation attack detection is an essential component of face recognition systems deployed in security-critical applications. Existing FAS methods have poor generalizability to unseen spoof types, camera sensors, and environmental conditions. Recently, vision transformer (ViT) models have been shown to be effective for the FAS task due to their ability to capture long-range dependencies among image patches. However, adaptive modules or auxiliary loss functions are often required to adapt pre-trained ViT weights learned on large-scale datasets such as ImageNet. In this work, we first show that initializing ViTs with multimodal (e.g., CLIP) pre-trained weights improves generalizability for the FAS task, which is in line with the zero-shot transfer capabilities of vision-language pre-trained (VLP) models. We then propose a novel approach for robust cross-domain FAS by grounding visual representations with the help of natural language. Specifically, we show that aligning the image representation with an ensemble of class descriptions (based on natural language semantics) improves FAS generalizability in low-data regimes. Finally, we propose a multimodal contrastive learning strategy to boost feature generalization further and bridge the gap between source and target domains. Extensive experiments on three standard protocols demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods, achieving better zero-shot transfer performance than five-shot transfer of ""adaptive ViTs"".

CiT: Curation in Training for Effective Vision-Language Data,"Large vision-language models are generally applicable to many downstream tasks, but come at an exorbitant training cost that only large institutions can afford. This paper trades generality for efficiency and presents Curation in Training (CiT), a simple and efficient vision-text learning algorithm that couples a data objective into training. CiT automatically yields quality data to speed-up contrastive image-text training and alleviates the need for an offline data filtering pipeline, allowing broad data sources (including raw image-text pairs from the web). CiT contains two loops: an outer loop curating the training data and an inner loop consuming the curated training data. The text encoder connects the two loops. Given metadata for tasks of interest, e.g., class names, and a large pool of image-text pairs, CiT alternatively selects relevant training data from the pool by measuring the similarity of their text embeddings and embeddings of the metadata. In our experiments, we observe that CiT can speed up training by over an order of magnitude, especially if the raw data size is large.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Xu_CiT_Curation_in_Training_for_Effective_Vision-Language_Data_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Gradient-Regulated Meta-Prompt Learning for Generalizable Vision-Language Models,"Prompt tuning, a recently emerging paradigm, enables the powerful vision-language pre-training models to adapt to downstream tasks in a parameter- and data- efficient way, by learning the ""soft prompts"" to condition frozen pre-training models. Though effective, it is particularly problematic in the few-shot scenario, where prompt tuning performance is sensitive to the initialization and requires a time-consuming process to find a good initialization, thus restricting the fast adaptation ability of the pre-training models. In addition, prompt tuning could undermine the generalizability of the pre-training models, because the learnable prompt tokens are easy to overfit to the limited training samples. To address these issues, we introduce a novel Gradient-RegulAted Meta-prompt learning (GRAM) framework that jointly meta-learns an efficient soft prompt initialization for better adaptation and a lightweight gradient regulating function for strong cross-domain generalizability in a meta-learning paradigm using only the unlabeled image-text pre-training data. Rather than designing a specific prompt tuning method, our GRAM can be easily incorporated into various prompt tuning methods in a model-agnostic way, and comprehensive experiments show that GRAM brings about consistent improvement for them in several settings (i.e., few-shot learning, cross-domain generalization, cross-dataset generalization, etc.) over 11 datasets. Further, experiments show that GRAM enables the orthogonal methods of textual and visual prompt tuning to work in a mutually-enhanced way, offering better generalizability beyond the uni-modal prompt tuning methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Li_Gradient-Regulated_Meta-Prompt_Learning_for_Generalizable_Vision-Language_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Open-Vocabulary Object Detection With an Open Corpus,"Existing open vocabulary object detection (OVD) works expand the object detector toward open categories by replacing the classifier with the category text embeddings and optimizing the region-text alignment on data of the base categories. However, both the class-agnostic proposal generator and the classifier are biased to the seen classes as demonstrated by the gaps of objectness and accuracy assessment between base and novel classes. In this paper, an open corpus, composed of a set of external object concepts and clustered to several centroids, is introduced to improve the generalization ability in the detector. We propose the generalized objectness assessment (GOAT) in the proposal generator based on the visual-text alignment, where the similarities of visual feature to the cluster centroids are summarized as the objectness. This simple heuristic evaluates objectness with concepts in open corpus and is thus generalized to open categories. We further propose category expanding (CE) with open corpus in two training tasks, which enables the detector to perceive more categories in the feature space and get more reasonable optimization direction. For the classification task, we introduce an open corpus classifier by reconstructing original classifier with similar words in text space. For the image-caption alignment task, the open corpus centroids are incorporated to enlarge the negative samples in the contrastive loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of GOAT and CE, which greatly improve the performance on novel classes and get new state-of-the-art on the OVD benchmarks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wang_Open-Vocabulary_Object_Detection_With_an_Open_Corpus_ICCV_2023_paper.html
MRM: Masked Relation Modeling for Medical Image Pre-Training with Genetics,"Modern deep learning techniques on automatic multimodal medical diagnosis rely on massive expert annotations, which is time-consuming and prohibitive. Recent masked image modeling (MIM)-based pre-training methods have witnessed impressive advances for learning meaningful representations from unlabeled data and transferring to downstream tasks. However, these methods focus on natural images and ignore the specific properties of medical data, yielding unsatisfying generalization performance on downstream medical diagnosis. In this paper, we aim to leverage genetics to boost image pre-training and present a masked relation modeling (MRM) framework. Instead of explicitly masking input data in previous MIM methods leading to loss of disease-related semantics, we design relation masking to mask out token-wise feature relation in both self- and cross-modality levels, which preserves intact semantics within the input and allows the model to learn rich disease-related information. Moreover, to enhance semantic relation modeling, we propose relation matching to align the sample-wise relation between the intact and masked features. The relation matching exploits inter-sample relation by encouraging global constraints in the feature space to render sufficient semantic relation for feature representation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework is simple yet powerful, achieving state-of-the-art transfer performance on various downstream diagnosis tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Yang_MRM_Masked_Relation_Modeling_for_Medical_Image_Pre-Training_with_Genetics_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Long-range Multimodal Pretraining for Movie Understanding,"Learning computer vision models from (and for) movies has a long-standing history. While great progress has been attained, there is still a need for a pretrained multimodal model that can perform well in the ever-growing set of movie understanding tasks the community has been establishing. In this work, we introduce Long-range Multimodal Pretraining, a strategy, and a model that leverages movie data to train transferable multimodal and cross-modal encoders. Our key idea is to learn from all modalities in a movie by observing and extracting relationships over a long-range. After pretraining, we run ablation studies on the LVU benchmark and validate our modeling choices and the importance of learning from long-range time spans. Our model achieves state-of-the-art on several LVU tasks while being much more data efficient than previous works. Finally, we evaluate our model's transferability by setting a new state-of-the-art in five different benchmarks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Argaw_Long-range_Multimodal_Pretraining_for_Movie_Understanding_ICCV_2023_paper.html
A Retrospect to Multi-prompt Learning across Vision and Language,"The vision community is undergoing the unprecedented progress with the emergence of Vision-Language Pretraining Models (VLMs). Prompt learning plays as the holy grail of accessing VLMs since it enables their fast adaptation to downstream tasks with limited resources. Whereas existing research milling around single-prompt paradigms, rarely investigate the technical potential behind their multi-prompt learning counterparts. This paper aims to provide a principled retrospect for vision-language multi-prompt learning. We extend the recent constant modality gap phenomenon to learnable prompts and then, justify the superiority of vision-language transfer with multi-prompt augmentation, empirically and theoretically. In terms of this observation, we propose an Energy-based Multi-prompt Learning (EMPL) to generate multiple prompt embeddings by drawing instances from an energy-based distribution, which is implicitly defined by VLMs. So our EMPL is not only parameter-efficient but also rigorously lead to the balance between in-domain and out-of-domain open-vocabulary generalization. Comprehensive experiments have been conducted to justify our claims and the excellence of EMPL.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Chen_A_Retrospect_to_Multi-prompt_Learning_across_Vision_and_Language_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Unsupervised Open-Vocabulary Object Localization in Videos,"In this paper, we show that recent advances in video representation learning and pre-trained vision-language models allow for substantial improvements in self-supervised video object localization. We propose a method that first localizes objects in videos via a slot attention approach and then assigns text to the obtained slots. The latter is achieved by an unsupervised way to read localized semantic information from the pre-trained CLIP model. The resulting video object localization is entirely unsupervised apart from the implicit annotation contained in CLIP, and it is effectively the first unsupervised approach that yields good results on regular video benchmarks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Fan_Unsupervised_Open-Vocabulary_Object_Localization_in_Videos_ICCV_2023_paper.html
DIME-FM : DIstilling Multimodal and Efficient Foundation Models,"Large Vision-Language Foundation Models (VLFM), such as CLIP, ALIGN and Florence, are trained on large private datasets of image-caption pairs and achieve superior transferability and robustness on downstream tasks, but they are difficult to use in many practical applications due to their large size, high latency and fixed architectures. Unfortunately, recent works show training a small custom VLFM for resource-limited applications is currently very difficult using public and smaller-scale data. In this paper, we introduce a new distillation mechanism (DIME-FM) that allows us to transfer the knowledge contained in large VLFMs to smaller, customized foundation models using a relatively small amount of inexpensive, unpaired images and sentences. We transfer the knowledge from the pre-trained CLIP-ViT-L/14 model to a ViT-B/32 model, with only 40M public images and 28.4M unpaired public sentences. The resulting model ""Distill-ViT-B/32"" rivals the CLIP-ViT-B/32 model pre-trained on its private WiT dataset (400M image-text pairs): Distill-ViT-B/32 achieves similar results in terms of zero-shot and linear-probing performance on both ImageNet and the ELEVATER (20 image classification tasks) benchmarks. It also displays comparable robustness when evaluated on five datasets with natural distribution shifts from ImageNet.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Sun_DIME-FM__DIstilling_Multimodal_and_Efficient_Foundation_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Video Action Recognition with Attentive Semantic Units,"Visual-Language Models (VLMs) have significantly advanced video action recognition. Supervised by the semantics of action labels, recent works adapt the visual branch of VLMs to learn video representations. Despite the effectiveness proved by these works, we believe that the potential of VLMs has yet to be fully harnessed. In light of this, we exploit the semantic units (SU) hiding behind the action labels and leverage their correlations with fine-grained items in frames for more accurate action recognition. SUs are entities extracted from the language descriptions of the entire action set, including body parts, objects, scenes, and motions. To further enhance the alignments between visual contents and the SUs, we introduce a multi-region module (MRA) to the visual branch of the VLM. The MRA allows the perception of region-aware visual features beyond the original global feature. Our method adaptively attends to and selects relevant SUs with visual features of frames. With a cross-modal decoder, the selected SUs serve to decode spatiotemporal video representations. In summary, the SUs as the medium can boost discriminative ability and transferability. Specifically, in fully-supervised learning, our method achieved 87.8% top-1 accuracy on Kinetics-400. In K=2 few-shot experiments, our method surpassed the previous state-of-the-art by +7.1% and +15.0% on HMDB-51 and UCF-101, respectively.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Chen_Video_Action_Recognition_with_Attentive_Semantic_Units_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Generative Prompt Model for Weakly Supervised Object Localization,"Weakly supervised object localization (WSOL) remains challenging when learning object localization models from image category labels. Conventional methods that discriminatively train activation models ignore representative yet less discriminative object parts. In this study, we propose a generative prompt model (GenPromp), defining the first generative pipeline to localize less discriminative object parts by formulating WSOL as a conditional image denoising procedure. During training, GenPromp converts image category labels to learnable prompt embeddings which are fed to a generative model to conditionally recover the input image with noise and learn representative embeddings. During inference, GenPromp combines the representative embeddings with discriminative embeddings (queried from an off-the-shelf vision-language model) for both representative and discriminative capacity. The combined embeddings are finally used to generate multi-scale high-quality attention maps, which facilitate localizing full object extent. Experiments on CUB-200-2011 and ILSVRC show that GenPromp respectively outperforms the best discriminative models by 5.2% and 5.6% (Top-1 Loc), setting a solid baseline for WSOL with the generative model. Code is available at https://github.com/callsys/GenPromp.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhao_Generative_Prompt_Model_for_Weakly_Supervised_Object_Localization_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Iterative Prompt Learning for Unsupervised Backlit Image Enhancement,"We propose a novel unsupervised backlit image enhancement method, abbreviated as CLIP-LIT, by exploring the potential of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training (CLIP) for pixel-level image enhancement. We show that the open-world CLIP prior not only aids in distinguishing between backlit and well-lit images, but also in perceiving heterogeneous regions with different luminance, facilitating the optimization of the enhancement network. Unlike high-level and image manipulation tasks, directly applying CLIP to enhancement tasks is non-trivial, owing to the difficulty in finding accurate prompts. To solve this issue, we devise a prompt learning framework that first learns an initial prompt pair by constraining the text-image similarity between the prompt (negative/positive sample) and the corresponding image (backlit image/well-lit image) in the CLIP latent space. Then, we train the enhancement network based on the text-image similarity between the enhanced result and the initial prompt pair. To further improve the accuracy of the initial prompt pair, we iteratively fine-tune the prompt learning framework to reduce the distribution gaps between the backlit images, enhanced results, and well-lit images via rank learning, boosting the enhancement performance. Our method alternates between updating the prompt learning framework and enhancement network until visually pleasing results are achieved. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of visual quality and generalization ability, without requiring any paired data.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Liang_Iterative_Prompt_Learning_for_Unsupervised_Backlit_Image_Enhancement_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Event Camera Data Pre-training,"This paper proposes a pre-trained neural network for handling event camera data. Our model is a self-supervised learning framework, and uses paired event camera data and natural RGB images for training. Our method contains three modules connected in a sequence: i) a family of event data augmentations, generating meaningful event images for self-supervised training; ii) a conditional masking strategy to sample informative event patches from event images, encouraging our model to capture the spatial layout of a scene and accelerating training; iii) a contrastive learning approach, enforcing the similarity of embeddings between matching event images, and between paired event and RGB images. An embedding projection loss is proposed to avoid the model collapse when enforcing the event image embedding similarities. A probability distribution alignment loss is proposed to encourage the event image to be consistent with its paired RGB image in the feature space. Transfer learning performance on downstream tasks shows the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods. For example, we achieve top-1 accuracy at 64.83% on the N-ImageNet dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yan98/Event-Camera-Data-Pre-training.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Yang_Event_Camera_Data_Pre-training_ICCV_2023_paper.html
CDUL: CLIP-Driven Unsupervised Learning for Multi-Label Image Classification,"This paper presents a CLIP-based unsupervised learning method for annotation-free multi-label image classification, including three stages: initialization, training, and inference. At the initialization stage, we take full advantage of the powerful CLIP model and propose a novel approach to extend CLIP for multi-label predictions based on global-local image-text similarity aggregation. To be more specific, we split each image into snippets and leverage CLIP to generate the similarity vector for the whole image (global) as well as each snippet (local). Then a similarity aggregator is introduced to leverage the global and local similarity vectors. Using the aggregated similarity scores as the initial pseudo labels at the training stage, we propose an optimization framework to train the parameters of the classification network and refine pseudo labels for unobserved labels. During inference, only the classification network is used to predict the labels of the input image. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods on MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC 2007, PASCAL VOC 2012, and NUS datasets and even achieves comparable results to weakly supervised classification methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Abdelfattah_CDUL_CLIP-Driven_Unsupervised_Learning_for_Multi-Label_Image_Classification_ICCV_2023_paper.html
"Misalign, Contrast then Distill: Rethinking Misalignments in Language-Image Pre-training","Contrastive Language-Image Pretraining has emerged as a prominent approach for training vision and text encoders with uncurated image-text pairs from the web. To enhance data-efficiency, recent efforts have introduced additional supervision terms that involve random-augmented views of the image. However, since the image augmentation process is unaware of its text counterpart, this procedure could cause various degrees of image-text misalignments during training. Prior methods either disregarded this discrepancy or introduced external models to mitigate the impact of misalignments during training. In contrast, we propose a novel metric learning approach that capitalizes on these misalignments as an additional training source, which we term ""Misalign, Contrast then Distill (MCD)"". Unlike previous methods that treat augmented images and their text counterparts as simple positive pairs, MCD predicts the continuous scales of misalignment caused by the augmentation. Our extensive experimental results show that our proposed MCD achieves state-of-the-art transferability in multiple classification and retrieval downstream datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Kim_Misalign_Contrast_then_Distill_Rethinking_Misalignments_in_Language-Image_Pre-training_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Efficient Adaptive Human-Object Interaction Detection with Concept-guided Memory,"Human Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize and infer the relationships between a human and an object. Arguably, training supervised models for this task from scratch presents challenges due to the performance drop over rare classes and the high computational cost and time required to handle long-tailed distributions of HOIs in complex HOI scenes in realistic settings. This observation motivates us to design an HOI detector that can be trained even with long-tailed labeled data and can leverage existing knowledge from pre-trained models. Inspired by the powerful generalization ability of the large Vision-Language Models (VLM) on classification and retrieval tasks, we propose an efficient Adaptive HOI Detector with Concept-guided Memory (ADA-CM). ADA-CM has two operating modes. The first mode makes it tunable without learning new parameters in a training-free paradigm. Its second mode incorporates an instance-aware adapter mechanism that can further efficiently boost performance if updating a lightweight set of parameters can be afforded. Our proposed method achieves competitive results with state-of-the-art on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets with much less training time. Code can be found at https://github.com/ltttpku/ADA-CM.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Lei_Efficient_Adaptive_Human-Object_Interaction_Detection_with_Concept-guided_Memory_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Attentive Mask CLIP,"In vision-language modeling, image token removal is an efficient augmentation technique to reduce the cost of encoding image features. The CLIP-style models, however, have been found to be negatively impacted by this technique. We hypothesize that removing a large portion of image tokens may inadvertently destroy the semantic information associated to a given text description, resulting in misaligned paired data in CLIP training. To address this issue, we propose an attentive token removal approach, which retains a small number of tokens that have a strong semantic correlation to the corresponding text description. The correlation scores are dynamically evaluated through an EMA-updated vision encoder. Our method, termed attentive mask CLIP, outperforms original CLIP and CLIP variant with random token removal while saving the training time. In addition, our approach also enables efficient multi-view contrastive learning. Experimentally, by training ViT-B on YFCC-15M dataset, our approach achieves 43.9% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K zero-shot classification, 62.7/42.1 and 38.0/23.2 I2T/T2I retrieval accuracy on Flickr30K and MS COCO, outperforming SLIP by +1.1%,+5.5/+0.9, and +4.4/+1.3, respectively, while being 2.30x faster. An efficient version of our approach runs 1.16x faster than the plain CLIP model, while achieving significant gains of +5.3%, +11.3/+8.0, and +9.5/+4.9 on these benchmarks, respectively.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Yang_Attentive_Mask_CLIP_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Evaluating Data Attribution for Text-to-Image Models,"While large text-to-image models are able to synthesize ""novel"" images, these images are necessarily a reflection of the training data. The problem of data attribution in such models -- which of the images in the training set are most responsible for the appearance of a given generated image -- is a difficult yet important one. As an initial step toward this problem, we evaluate attribution through ""customization"" methods, which tune an existing large-scale model toward a given exemplar object or style. Our key insight is that this allows us to efficiently create synthetic images that are computationally influenced by the exemplar by construction. With our new dataset of such exemplar-influenced images, we are able to evaluate various data attribution algorithms and different possible feature spaces. Furthermore, by training on our dataset, we can tune standard models, such as DINO, CLIP, and ViT, toward the attribution problem. Even though the procedure is tuned towards small exemplar sets, we show generalization to larger sets. Finally, by taking into account the inherent uncertainty of the problem, we can assign soft attribution scores over a set of training images.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wang_Evaluating_Data_Attribution_for_Text-to-Image_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Going Denser with Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation,"Object detection has been expanded from a limited number of categories to open vocabulary. Moving forward, a complete intelligent vision system requires understanding more fine-grained object descriptions, object parts. In this paper, we propose a detector with the ability to predict both open-vocabulary objects and their part segmentation. This ability comes from two designs. First, we train the detector on the joint of part-level, object-level and image-level data to build the multi-granularity alignment between language and image. Second, we parse the novel object into its parts by its dense semantic correspondence with the base object. These two designs enable the detector to largely benefit from various data sources and foundation models. In open-vocabulary part segmentation experiments, our method outperforms the baseline by 3.3 7.3 mAP in cross-dataset generalization on PartImageNet, and improves the baseline by 7.3 novel AP50 in cross-category generalization on Pascal Part. Finally, we train a detector that generalizes to a wide range of part segmentation datasets while achieving better performance than dataset-specific training.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Sun_Going_Denser_with_Open-Vocabulary_Part_Segmentation_ICCV_2023_paper.html
VL-Match: Enhancing Vision-Language Pretraining with Token-Level and Instance-Level Matching,"Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) has significantly improved the performance of various vision-language tasks with the matching of images and texts. In this paper, we propose VL-Match, a Vision-Language framework with Enhanced Token-level and Instance-level Matching. At the token level, a Vision-Language Replaced Token Detection task is designed to boost the substantial interaction between text tokens and images, where the text encoder of VLP works as a generator to generate a corrupted text, and the multimodal encoder of VLP works as a discriminator to predict whether each text token in the corrupted text matches the image. At the instance level, in the Image-Text Matching task that judges whether an image-text pair is matched, we propose a novel bootstrapping method to generate hard negative text samples that are different from the positive ones only at the token level. In this way, we can force the network to detect fine-grained differences between images and texts. Notably, with a smaller amount of parameters, VL-Match significantly outperforms previous SOTA on all image-text retrieval tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Bi_VL-Match_Enhancing_Vision-Language_Pretraining_with_Token-Level_and_Instance-Level_Matching_ICCV_2023_paper.html
TextManiA: Enriching Visual Feature by Text-driven Manifold Augmentation,"We propose TextManiA, a text-driven manifold augmentation method that semantically enriches visual feature spaces, regardless of class distribution. TextManiA augments visual data with intra-class semantic perturbation by exploiting easy-to-understand visually mimetic words, i.e., attributes. This work is built on an interesting hypothesis that general language models, e.g., BERT and GPT, encompass visual information to some extent, even without training on visual training data. Given the hypothesis, TextManiA transfers pre-trained text representation obtained from a well-established large language encoder to a target visual feature space being learned. Our extensive analysis hints that the language encoder indeed encompasses visual information at least useful to augment visual representation. Our experiments demonstrate that TextManiA is particularly powerful in scarce samples with class imbalance as well as even distribution. We also show compatibility with the label mix-based approaches in evenly distributed scarce data.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Ye-Bin_TextManiA_Enriching_Visual_Feature_by_Text-driven_Manifold_Augmentation_ICCV_2023_paper.html
ViLLA: Fine-Grained Vision-Language Representation Learning from Real-World Data,"Vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP and ALIGN, are generally trained on datasets consisting of image-caption pairs obtained from the web. However, real-world multimodal datasets, such as healthcare data, are significantly more complex: each image (e.g. X-ray) is often paired with text (e.g. physician report) that describes many distinct attributes occurring in fine-grained regions of the image. We refer to these samples as exhibiting high pairwise complexity, since each image-text pair can be decomposed into a large number of region-attribute pairings. The extent to which VLMs can capture fine-grained relationships between image regions and textual attributes when trained on such data has not been previously evaluated. The first key contribution of this work is to demonstrate through systematic evaluations that as the pairwise complexity of the training dataset increases, standard VLMs struggle to learn region-attribute relationships, exhibiting performance degradations of up to 37% on retrieval tasks. In order to address this issue, we introduce ViLLA as our second key contribution. ViLLA, which is trained to capture fine-grained region-attribute relationships from complex datasets, involves two components: (a) a lightweight, self-supervised mapping model to decompose image-text samples into region-attribute pairs, and (b) a contrastive VLM to learn representations from generated region-attribute pairs. We demonstrate with experiments across four domains (synthetic, product, medical, and natural images) that ViLLA outperforms comparable VLMs on fine-grained reasoning tasks, such as zero-shot object detection (up to 3.6 AP50 points on COCO and 0.6 mAP points on LVIS) and retrieval (up to 14.2 R-Precision points).",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Varma_ViLLA_Fine-Grained_Vision-Language_Representation_Learning_from_Real-World_Data_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Towards Unifying Medical Vision-and-Language Pre-Training via Soft Prompts,"Medical vision-and-language pre-training (Med-VLP) has shown promising improvements on many downstream medical tasks owing to its applicability to extracting generic representations from medical images and texts. Practically, there exist two typical types, i.e., the fusion-encoder type and the dual-encoder type, depending on whether a heavy fusion module is used. The former is superior at multi-modal tasks owing to the sufficient interaction between modalities; the latter is good at uni-modal and cross-modal tasks due to the single-modality encoding ability. To take advantage of these two types, we propose an effective yet straightforward scheme named PTUnifier to unify the two types. We first unify the input format by introducing visual and textual prompts, which serve as DETR-like queries that assist in extracting features when one of the modalities is missing. By doing so, a single model could serve as a foundation model that processes various tasks adopting different input formats (i.e., image-only, text-only, and image-text-pair). Furthermore, we construct a prompt pool (instead of static ones) to improve diversity and scalability, enabling queries conditioned on different input instances. Experimental results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a broad range of tasks, spanning uni-modal tasks (i.e., image/text classification and text summarization), cross-modal tasks (i.e., image-to-text generation and image-text/text-image retrieval), and multi-modal tasks (i.e., visual question answering), demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. Note that the adoption of prompts is orthogonal to most existing Med-VLP approaches and could be a beneficial and complementary extension to these approaches. The source code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/ICCV-2023-Submission-PTUnifier/ and will be released in the final version of this paper.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Chen_Towards_Unifying_Medical_Vision-and-Language_Pre-Training_via_Soft_Prompts_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Sound Localization from Motion: Jointly Learning Sound Direction and Camera Rotation,"The images and sounds that we perceive undergo subtle but geometrically consistent changes as we rotate our heads. In this paper, we use these cues to solve a problem we call Sound Localization from Motion (SLfM): jointly estimating camera rotation and localizing sound sources. We learn to solve these tasks solely through self-supervision. A visual model predicts camera rotation from a pair of images, while an audio model predicts the direction of sound sources from binaural sounds. We train these models to generate predictions that agree with one another. At test time, the models can be deployed independently. To obtain a feature representation that is well-suited to solving this challenging problem, we also propose a method for learning an audio-visual representation through cross-view binauralization: estimating binaural sound from one view, given images and sound from another. Our model can successfully estimate accurate rotations on both real and synthetic scenes, and localize sound sources with accuracy competitive with state-of-the-art self-supervised approaches.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Chen_Sound_Localization_from_Motion_Jointly_Learning_Sound_Direction_and_Camera_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Bayesian Prompt Learning for Image-Language Model Generalization,"Foundational image-language models have generated considerable interest due to their efficient adaptation to downstream tasks by prompt learning. Prompt learning treats part of the language model input as trainable while freezing the rest, and optimizes an Empirical Risk Minimization objective. However, Empirical Risk Minimization is known to suffer from distributional shifts which hurt generalizability to prompts unseen during training. By leveraging the regularization ability of Bayesian methods, we frame prompt learning from the Bayesian perspective and formulate it as a variational inference problem. Our approach regularizes the prompt space, reduces overfitting to the seen prompts and improves the prompt generalization on unseen prompts. Our framework is implemented by modeling the input prompt space in a probabilistic manner, as an a priori distribution which makes our proposal compatible with prompt learning approaches that are unconditional or conditional on the image. We demonstrate empirically on 15 benchmarks that Bayesian prompt learning provides an appropriate coverage of the prompt space, prevents learning spurious features, and exploits transferable invariant features. This results in better generalization of unseen prompts, even across different datasets and domains.

VLSlice: Interactive Vision-and-Language Slice Discovery,"Recent work in vision-and-language demonstrates that large-scale pretraining can learn generalizable models that are efficiently transferable to downstream tasks. While this may improve dataset-scale aggregate metrics, analyzing performance around hand-crafted subgroups targeting specific bias dimensions reveals systemic undesirable behaviors. However, this subgroup analysis is frequently stalled by annotation efforts, which require extensive time and resources to collect the necessary data. Prior art attempts to automatically discover subgroups to circumvent these constraints but typically leverages model behavior on existing task-specific annotations and rapidly degrades on more complex inputs beyond ""tabular"" data, none of which study vision-and-language models. This paper presents VLSlice, an interactive system enabling user-guided discovery of coherent representation-level subgroups with consistent visiolinguistic behavior, denoted as vision-and-language slices, from unlabeled image sets. We show that VLSlice enables users to quickly generate diverse high-coherency slices in a user study (n=22) and release the tool publicly.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Slyman_VLSlice_Interactive_Vision-and-Language_Slice_Discovery_ICCV_2023_paper.html
DocTr: Document Transformer for Structured Information Extraction in Documents,"We present a new formulation for structured information extraction (SIE) from visually rich documents. We address the limitations of existing IOB tagging and graph-based formulations, which are either overly reliant on the correct ordering of input text or struggle with decoding a complex graph. Instead, motivated by anchor-based object detectors in computer vision, we represent an entity as an anchor word and a bounding box, and represent entity linking as the association between anchor words. This is more robust to text ordering, and maintains a compact graph for entity linking. The formulation motivates us to introduce 1) a Document Transformer (DocTr) that aims at detecting and associating entity bounding boxes in visually rich documents, and 2) a simple pre-training strategy that helps learn entity detection in the context of language. Evaluations on three SIE benchmarks show the effectiveness of the proposed formulation, and the overall approach outperforms existing solutions.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Liao_DocTr_Document_Transformer_for_Structured_Information_Extraction_in_Documents_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Practical Membership Inference Attacks Against Large-Scale Multi-Modal Models: A Pilot Study,"Membership inference attacks (MIAs) aim to infer whether a data point has been used to train a machine learning model. These attacks can be employed to identify potential privacy vulnerabilities and detect unauthorized use of personal data. While MIAs have been traditionally studied for simple classification models, recent advancements in multi-modal pre-training, such as CLIP, have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot performance across a range of computer vision tasks. However, the sheer scale of data and models presents significant computational challenges for performing the attacks. 
  
  This paper takes a first step towards developing practical MIAs against large-scale multi-modal models. We introduce a simple baseline strategy by thresholding the cosine similarity between text and image features of a target point, and propose further enhancing the baseline by aggregating cosine similarity across transformations of the target. We also present a new weakly supervised attack method that leverages ground-truth non-members (e.g., obtained by using the publication date of a target model and the timestamps of the open data) to further enhance the attack. Our evaluation shows that CLIP models are susceptible to our attack strategies, with our simple baseline achieving over 75% membership identification accuracy. Furthermore, our enhanced attacks outperform the baseline across multiple models and datasets, with the weakly supervised attack demonstrating an average-case performance improvement of 17% and being at least 7X more effective at low false-positive rates. These findings highlight the importance of protecting the privacy of multi-modal foundational models, which were previously assumed to be less susceptible to MIAs due to less overfitting. The reach of the results presents unique challenges and insights for the broader community to address multi-modal privacy concerns.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Ko_Practical_Membership_Inference_Attacks_Against_Large-Scale_Multi-Modal_Models_A_Pilot_ICCV_2023_paper.html
What Can a Cook in Italy Teach a Mechanic in India? Action Recognition Generalisation Over Scenarios and Locations,"We propose and address a new generalisation problem: can a model trained for action recognition successfully classify actions when they are performed within a previously unseen scenario and in a previously unseen location? To answer this question, we introduce the Action Recognition Generalisation Over scenarios and locations dataset ARGO1M, which contains 1.1M video clips from the large-scale Ego4D dataset, across 10 scenarios and 13 locations. We demonstrate recognition models struggle to generalise over 10 proposed test splits, each of an unseen scenario in an unseen location. We thus propose CIR, a method to represent each video as a Cross-Instance Reconstruction of videos from other domains. Reconstructions are paired with text narrations to guide the learning of a domain generalisable representation. We provide extensive analysis and ablations on ARGO1M that show CIR outperforms prior domain generalisation works on all test splits.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Plizzari_What_Can_a_Cook_in_Italy_Teach_a_Mechanic_in_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Introducing Language Guidance in Prompt-based Continual Learning,"Continual Learning aims to learn a single model on a sequence of tasks without having access to data from previous tasks. The biggest challenge in the domain still remains catastrophic forgetting: a loss in performance on seen classes of earlier tasks. Some existing methods rely on an expensive replay buffer to store a chunk of data from previous tasks. This, while promising, becomes expensive when the number of tasks becomes large or data can not be stored for privacy reasons. As an alternative, prompt-based methods have been proposed that store the task information in a learnable prompt pool. This prompt pool instructs a frozen image encoder on how to solve each task. While the model faces a disjoint set of classes in each task in this setting, we argue that these classes can be encoded to the same embedding space of a pre-trained language encoder. In this work, we propose Language Guidance for Prompt-based Continual Learning (LGCL) as a plug-in for prompt-based methods. LGCL is model agnostic and introduces language guidance at the task level in the prompt pool and at the class level on the output feature of the vision encoder. We show with extensive experimentation that LGCL consistently improves the performance of prompt-based continual learning methods to set a new state-of-the-art. LGCL achieves these performance improvements without needing any additional learnable parameters.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Khan_Introducing_Language_Guidance_in_Prompt-based_Continual_Learning_ICCV_2023_paper.html
HiTeA: Hierarchical Temporal-Aware Video-Language Pre-training,"Video-language pre-training has advanced the performance of various downstream video-language tasks. However, most previous methods directly inherit or adapt typical image-language pre-training paradigms to video-language pre-training, thus not fully exploiting the unique characteristic of video, i.e., temporal. In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Temporal-Aware video-language pre-training framework, HiTeA, with two novel pre-training tasks for yielding temporal-aware multi-modal representation with cross-modal fine-grained temporal moment information and temporal contextual relations between video-text multi-modal pairs. First, we propose a cross-modal moment exploration task to explore moments in videos by mining the paired texts, which results in detailed video moment representation. Then, based on the learned detailed moment representations, the inherent temporal contextual relations are captured by aligning video-text pairs as a whole in different time resolutions with multi-modal temporal relation exploration task. Furthermore, we introduce the shuffling test to evaluate the temporal reliance of datasets and video-language pre-training models. We achieve state-of-the-art results on 15 well-established video-language understanding and generation tasks, especially on temporal-oriented datasets (e.g., SSv2-Template and SSv2-Label) with 8.6% and 11.1% improvement respectively. HiTeA also demonstrates strong generalization ability when directly transferred to downstream tasks in a zero-shot manner.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Ye_HiTeA_Hierarchical_Temporal-Aware_Video-Language_Pre-training_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Set-level Guidance Attack: Boosting Adversarial Transferability of Vision-Language Pre-training Models,"Vision-language pre-training (VLP) models have shown vulnerability to adversarial examples in multimodal tasks. Furthermore, malicious adversaries can be deliberately transferred to attack other black-box models. However, existing work has mainly focused on investigating white-box attacks. In this paper, we present the first study to investigate the adversarial transferability of recent VLP models. We observe that existing methods exhibit much lower transferability, compared to the strong attack performance in white-box settings. The transferability degradation is partly caused by the under-utilization of cross-modal interactions. Particularly, unlike unimodal learning, VLP models rely heavily on cross-modal interactions and the multimodal alignments are many-to-many, e.g., an image can be described in various natural languages. To this end, we propose a highly transferable Set-level Guidance Attack (SGA) that thoroughly leverages modality interactions and incorporates alignment-preserving augmentation with cross-modal guidance. Experimental results demonstrate that SGA could generate adversarial examples that can strongly transfer across different VLP models on multiple downstream vision-language tasks. On image-text retrieval, SGA significantly enhances the attack success rate for transfer attacks from ALBEF to TCL by a large margin (at least 9.78% and up to 30.21%), compared to the state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zoky-2020/SGA.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Lu_Set-level_Guidance_Attack_Boosting_Adversarial_Transferability_of_Vision-Language_Pre-training_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
HiVLP: Hierarchical Interactive Video-Language Pre-Training,"Video-Language Pre-training (VLP) has become one of the most popular research topics in deep learning. However, compared to image-language pre-training, VLP has lagged far behind due to the lack of large amounts of video-text pairs. In this work, we train a VLP model with a hybrid of image-text and video-text pairs, which significantly outperforms pre-training with only the video-text pairs. Besides, existing methods usually model the cross-modal interaction using cross-attention between single-scale visual tokens and textual tokens. These visual features are either of low resolutions lacking fine-grained information, or of high resolutions without high-level semantics. To address the issue, we propose Hierarchical interactive Video-Language Pre-training (HiVLP) that efficiently uses a hierarchical visual feature group for multi-modal cross-attention during pre-training. In the hierarchical framework, low-resolution features are learned with focus on more global high-level semantic information, while high-resolution features carry fine-grained details. As a result, HiVLP has the ability to effectively learn both the global and fine-grained representations to achieve better alignment between video and text inputs. Furthermore, we design a hierarchical multi-scale vision contrastive loss for self-supervised learning to boost the interaction between them. Experimental results show that HiVLP establishes new state-of-the-art results in three downstream tasks, text-video retrieval, video-text retrieval, and video captioning.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Shao_HiVLP_Hierarchical_Interactive_Video-Language_Pre-Training_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Unified Pre-Training with Pseudo Texts for Text-To-Image Person Re-Identification,"The pre-training task is indispensable for the text-to-image person re-identification (T2I-ReID) task. However, there are two underlying inconsistencies between these two tasks that may impact the performance: i) Data inconsistency. A large domain gap exists between the generic images/texts used in public pre-trained models and the specific person data in the T2I-ReID task. This gap is especially severe for texts, as general textual data are usually unable to describe specific people in fine-grained detail. ii) Training inconsistency. The processes of pre-training of images and texts are independent, despite cross-modality learning being critical to T2I-ReID. To address the above issues, we present a new unified pre-training pipeline (UniPT) designed specifically for the T2I-ReID task. We first build a large-scale text-labeled person dataset ""LUPerson-T"", in which pseudo-textual descriptions of images are automatically generated by the CLIP paradigm using a divide-conquer-combine strategy. Benefiting from this dataset, we then utilize a simple vision-and-language pre-training framework to explicitly align the feature space of the image and text modalities during pre-training. In this way, the pre-training task and the T2I-ReID task are made consistent with each other on both data and training levels. Without the need for any bells and whistles, our UniPT achieves competitive Rank-1 accuracy of, i.e., 68.50%, 60.09%, and 51.85% on CUHK-PEDES, ICFG-PEDES and RSTPReid, respectively. Both the LUPerson-T dataset and code are available at https://github.com/ZhiyinShao-H/UniPT.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Shao_Unified_Pre-Training_with_Pseudo_Texts_for_Text-To-Image_Person_Re-Identification_ICCV_2023_paper.html
CLIP-Cluster: CLIP-Guided Attribute Hallucination for Face Clustering,"One of the most important yet rarely studied challenges for supervised face clustering is the large intra-class variance caused by different face attributes such as age, pose, and expression. Images of the same identity but with different face attributes usually tend to be clustered into different sub-clusters. For the first time, we proposed an attribute hallucination framework named CLIP-Cluster to address this issue, which first hallucinates multiple representations for different attributes with the powerful CLIP model and then pools them by learning neighbor-adaptive attention. Specifically, CLIP-Cluster first introduces a text-driven attribute hallucination module, which allows one to use natural language as the interface to hallucinate novel attributes for a given face image based on the well-aligned image-language CLIP space. Furthermore, we develop a neighbor-aware proxy generator that fuses the features describing various attributes into a proxy feature to build a bridge among different sub-clusters and reduce the intra-class variance. The proxy feature is generated by adaptively attending to the hallucinated visual features and the source one based on the local neighbor information. On this basis, a graph built with the proxy representations is used for subsequent clustering operations. Extensive experiments show our proposed approach outperforms state-of-the-art face clustering methods with high inference efficiency.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Shen_CLIP-Cluster_CLIP-Guided_Attribute_Hallucination_for_Face_Clustering_ICCV_2023_paper.html
DiffDis: Empowering Generative Diffusion Model with Cross-Modal Discrimination Capability,"Recently, large-scale diffusion models, e.g., Stable diffusion and DallE2, have shown remarkable results on image synthesis. On the other hand, large-scale cross-modal pre-trained models (e.g., CLIP, ALIGN, and FILIP) are competent for various downstream tasks by learning to align vision and language embeddings. In this paper, we explore the possibility of jointly modeling generation and discrimination. Specifically, we propose DiffDis to unify the cross-modal generative and discriminative pretraining into one single framework under the diffusion process. DiffDis first formulates the image-text discriminative problem as a generative diffusion process of the text embedding from the text encoder conditioned on the image. Then, we propose a novel dual-stream network architecture, which fuses the noisy text embedding with the knowledge of latent images from different scales for image-text discriminative learning. Moreover, the generative and discriminative tasks can efficiently share the image-branch network structure in the multi-modality model. Benefiting from diffusion-based unified training, DiffDis achieves both better generation ability and cross-modal semantic alignment in one architecture. Experimental results show that DiffDis outperforms single-task models on both the image generation and the image-text discriminative tasks, e.g., 1.65% improvement on average accuracy of zero-shot classification over 12 datasets and 2.42 improvement on FID of zero-shot image synthesis.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Huang_DiffDis_Empowering_Generative_Diffusion_Model_with_Cross-Modal_Discrimination_Capability_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Distilling DETR with Visual-Linguistic Knowledge for Open-Vocabulary Object Detection,"Current methods for open-vocabulary object detection (OVOD) rely on a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to acquire the recognition ability. In this paper, we propose a simple yet effective framework to Distill the Knowledge from the VLM to a DETR-like detector, termed DK-DETR. Specifically, we present two ingenious distillation schemes named semantic knowledge distillation (SKD) and relational knowledge distillation (RKD). To utilize the rich knowledge from the VLM systematically, SKD transfers the semantic knowledge explicitly, while RKD exploits implicit relationship information between objects. Furthermore, a distillation branch including a group of auxiliary queries is added to the detector to mitigate the negative effect on base categories. Equipped with SKD and RKD on the distillation branch, DK-DETR improves the detection performance of novel categories significantly and avoids disturbing the detection of base categories. Extensive experiments on LVIS and COCO datasets show that DK-DETR surpasses existing OVOD methods under the setting that the base-category supervision is solely available. The code and models are available at https://github.com/hikvision-research/opera.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Li_Distilling_DETR_with_Visual-Linguistic_Knowledge_for_Open-Vocabulary_Object_Detection_ICCV_2023_paper.html
GrowCLIP: Data-Aware Automatic Model Growing for Large-scale Contrastive Language-Image Pre-Training,"Cross-modal pre-training has shown impressive performance on a wide range of downstream tasks, benefiting from massive image-text pairs collected from the Internet. In practice, online data are growing constantly, highlighting the importance of the ability of pre-trained model to learn from data that is continuously growing. Existing works on cross-modal pre-training mainly focus on training a network with fixed architecture. However, it is impractical to limit the model capacity when considering the continuously growing nature of pre-training data in real-world applications. On the other hand, it is important to utilize the knowledge in current model to obtain efficient training and better performance. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose GrowCLIP, a data-driven automatic model growing algorithm for contrastive language-image pre-training with continuous image-text pairs as input. Specially, we adopt a dynamic growth space and seek out the optimal architecture at each growth step to adapt to online learning scenarios. And the shared encoder is proposed in our growth space to enhance the degree of cross-modal fusion. Besides, we explore the effect of growth in different dimensions, which could provide future references for the design of cross-modal model architecture. Finally, we employ parameter inheriting with momentum (PIM) to maintain the previous knowledge and address the issue of local minimum dilemma. Compared with the existing methods, GrowCLIP improve 2.3% average top-1 accuracy on zero-shot image classification of 9 downstream tasks. As for zero-shot image retrieval, GrowCLIP can improve 1.2% for top-1 image-to-text recall on Flickr30K dataset.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Deng_GrowCLIP_Data-Aware_Automatic_Model_Growing_for_Large-scale_Contrastive_Language-Image_Pre-Training_ICCV_2023_paper.html
CLIPTrans: Transferring Visual Knowledge with Pre-trained Models for Multimodal Machine Translation,"There has been a growing interest in developing multimodal machine translation (MMT) systems that enhance neural machine translation (NMT) with visual knowledge. This problem setup involves using images as auxiliary information during training, and more recently, eliminating their use during inference. Towards this end, previous works face a challenge in training powerful MMT models from scratch due to the scarcity of annotated multilingual vision-language data, especially for low-resource languages. Simultaneously, there has been an influx of multilingual pre-trained models for NMT and multimodal pre-trained models for vision-language tasks, primarily in English, which have shown exceptional generalisation ability. However, these are not directly applicable to MMT since they do not provide aligned multimodal multilingual features for generative tasks. To alleviate this issue, instead of designing complex modules for MMT, we propose CLIPTrans, which simply adapts the independently pre-trained multimodal M-CLIP and the multilingual mBART. In order to align their embedding spaces, mBART is conditioned on the M-CLIP features by a prefix sequence generated through a lightweight mapping network. We train this in a two-stage pipeline which warms up the model with image captioning before the actual translation task. Through experiments, we demonstrate the merits of this framework and consequently push forward the state-of-the-art across standard benchmarks by an average of +2.67 BLEU. The code can be found at www.github.com/devaansh100/CLIPTrans.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Gupta_CLIPTrans_Transferring_Visual_Knowledge_with_Pre-trained_Models_for_Multimodal_Machine_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Blending-NeRF: Text-Driven Localized Editing in Neural Radiance Fields,"Text-driven localized editing of 3D objects is particularly difficult as locally mixing the original 3D object with the intended new object and style effects without distorting the object's form is not a straightforward process. To address this issue, we propose a novel NeRF-based model, Blending-NeRF, which consists of two NeRF networks: pretrained NeRF and editable NeRF. Additionally, we introduce new blending operations that allow Blending-NeRF to properly edit target regions which are localized by text. By using a pretrained vision-language aligned model, CLIP, we guide Blending-NeRF to add new objects with varying colors and densities, modify textures, and remove parts of the original object. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that Blending-NeRF produces naturally and locally edited 3D objects from various text prompts.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Song_Blending-NeRF_Text-Driven_Localized_Editing_in_Neural_Radiance_Fields_ICCV_2023_paper.html
PADCLIP: Pseudo-labeling with Adaptive Debiasing in CLIP for Unsupervised Domain Adaptation,"Traditional Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) leverages the labeled source domain to tackle the learning tasks on the unlabeled target domain. It can be more challenging when a large domain gap exists between the source and the target domain. A more practical setting is to utilize a large-scale pre-trained model to fill the domain gap. For example, CLIP shows promising zero-shot generalizability to bridge the gap. However, after applying traditional fine-tuning to specifically adjust CLIP on a target domain, CLIP suffers from catastrophic forgetting issues where the new domain knowledge can quickly override CLIP's pre-trained knowledge and decreases the accuracy by half. We propose Catastrophic Forgetting Measurement (CFM) to adjust the learning rate to avoid excessive training (thus mitigating the catastrophic forgetting issue). We then utilize CLIP's zero-shot prediction to formulate a Pseudo-labeling setting with Adaptive Debiasing in CLIP (PADCLIP) by adjusting causal inference with our momentum and CFM. Our PADCLIP allows end-to-end training on source and target domains without extra overhead, and we achieved the best results on four public datasets, with a significant improvement (+18.5% accuracy) on DomainNet.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Lai_PADCLIP_Pseudo-labeling_with_Adaptive_Debiasing_in_CLIP_for_Unsupervised_Domain_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Label-Free Event-based Object Recognition via Joint Learning with Image Reconstruction from Events,"Recognizing objects from sparse and noisy events becomes extremely difficult when paired images and category labels do not exist. In this paper, we study label-free event-based object recognition where category labels and paired images are not available. To this end, we propose a joint formulation of object recognition and image reconstruction in a complementary manner. Our method first reconstructs images from events and performs object recognition through Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP), enabling better recognition through a rich context of images. Since the category information is essential in reconstructing images, we propose category-guided attraction loss and category-agnostic repulsion loss to bridge the textual features of predicted categories and the visual features of reconstructed images using CLIP. Moreover, we introduce a reliable data sampling strategy and local-global reconstruction consistency to boost joint learning of two tasks. To enhance the accuracy of prediction and quality of reconstruction, we also propose a prototype-based approach using unpaired images. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method and its extensibility for zero-shot object recognition. Our project code is available at https://github.com/Chohoonhee/Ev-LaFOR.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Cho_Label-Free_Event-based_Object_Recognition_via_Joint_Learning_with_Image_Reconstruction_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Gloss-Free Sign Language Translation: Improving from Visual-Language Pretraining,"Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task due to its cross-domain nature, involving the translation of visual-gestural language to text. Many previous methods employ an intermediate representation,i.e., gloss sequences, to facilitate SLT, thus transforming it into a two-stage task of sign language recognition (SLR) followed by sign language translation (SLT). However, the scarcity of gloss-annotated sign language data, combined with the information bottleneck in the mid-level gloss representation, has hindered the further development of the SLT task. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Gloss-Free SLT base on Visual-Language Pretraining (GFSLT-VLP), which improves SLT by inheriting language-oriented prior knowledge from pre-trained models, without any gloss annotation assistance. Our approach involves two stages: (i) integrating Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) with masked self-supervised learning to create pre-tasks that bridge the semantic gap between visual and textual representations and restore masked sentences, and (ii) constructing an end-to-end architecture with an encoder-decoder-like structure that inherits the parameters of the pre-trained Visual Encoder and Text Decoder from the first stage. The seamless combination of these novel designs forms a robust sign language representation and significantly improves gloss-free sign language translation. In particular, we have achieved unprecedented improvements in terms of BLEU-4 score on the PHOENIX14T dataset (>=+5) and the CSL-Daily dataset (>=+3) compared to state-of-the-art gloss-free SLT methods. Furthermore, our approach also achieves competitive results on the PHOENIX14T dataset when compared with most of the gloss-based methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhou_Gloss-Free_Sign_Language_Translation_Improving_from_Visual-Language_Pretraining_ICCV_2023_paper.html
EgoVLPv2: Egocentric Video-Language Pre-training with Fusion in the Backbone,"Video-language pre-training (VLP) has become increasingly important due to its ability to generalize to various vision and language tasks. However, existing egocentric VLP frameworks utilize separate video and language encoders and learn task-specific cross-modal information only during fine-tuning, limiting the development of a unified system. In this work, we introduce the second generation of egocentric video-language pre-training (EgoVLPv2), a significant improvement from the previous generation, by incorporating cross-modal fusion directly into the video and language backbones. EgoVLPv2 learns strong video-text representation during pre-training and reuses the cross-modal attention modules to support different downstream tasks in a flexible and efficient manner, reducing fine-tuning costs. Moreover, our proposed fusion in the backbone strategy is more lightweight and compute-efficient than stacking additional fusion-specific layers. Extensive experiments on a wide range of VL tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of EgoVLPv2 by achieving consistent state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines across all downstream.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Pramanick_EgoVLPv2_Egocentric_Video-Language_Pre-training_with_Fusion_in_the_Backbone_ICCV_2023_paper.html
SMAUG: Sparse Masked Autoencoder for Efficient Video-Language Pre-Training,"Video-language pre-training is crucial for learning powerful multi-modal representation. However, it typically requires a massive amount of computation. In this paper, we develop SMAUG, an efficient pre-training framework for video-language models. The foundation component in SMAUG is masked autoencoders. Different from prior works which only mask textual inputs, our masking strategy considers both visual and textual modalities, providing a better cross-modal alignment and saving more pre-training costs. On top of that, we introduce a space-time token sparsification module, which leverages context information to further select only ""important"" spatial regions and temporal frames for pre-training. Coupling all these designs allows our method to enjoy both competitive performances on text-to-video retrieval and video question answering tasks, and much less pre-training costs by 1.9x or more. For example, our SMAUG only needs  50 NVIDIA A6000 GPU hours for pre-training to attain competitive performances on these two video-language tasks across six popular benchmarks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Lin_SMAUG_Sparse_Masked_Autoencoder_for_Efficient_Video-Language_Pre-Training_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Helping Hands: An Object-Aware Ego-Centric Video Recognition Model,"We introduce an object-aware decoder for improving the performance of spatio-temporal representations on ego-centric videos. The key idea is to enhance object-awareness during training by tasking the model to predict hand positions, object positions, and the semantic label of the objects using paired captions when available. At inference time the model only requires RGB frames as inputs, and is able to track and ground objects (although it has not been trained explicitly for this).
 
 We demonstrate the performance of the object-aware representations learnt by our model, by: (i) evaluating it for strong transfer, i.e, through zero-shot testing, on a number of downstream video-text retrieval and classification benchmarks; and (ii) by evaluating its temporal and spatial (grounding) performance by fine-tuning for this task. 
 
 In all cases the performance improves over the state of the art -- even for networks trained with far larger batch sizes. Overall, we show that the model can act as a drop-in replacement for an ego-centric video model, and improve performance.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhang_Helping_Hands_An_Object-Aware_Ego-Centric_Video_Recognition_Model_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Learning Concise and Descriptive Attributes for Visual Recognition,"Recent advances in foundation models present new opportunities for interpretable visual recognition -- one can first query Large Language Models (LLMs) to obtain a set of attributes that describe each class, then apply vision-language models to classify images via these attributes. Pioneering work shows that querying thousands of attributes can achieve performance competitive with image features. However, our further investigation on 8 datasets reveals that LLM-generated attributes in a large quantity perform almost the same as random words. This surprising finding suggests that significant noise may be present in these attributes. We hypothesize that there exist subsets of attributes that can maintain the classification performance with much smaller sizes, and propose a novel learning-to-search method to discover those concise sets of attributes. As a result, on the CUB dataset, our method achieves performance close to that of massive LLM-generated attributes (e.g., 10k attributes for CUB), yet using only 32 attributes in total to distinguish 200 bird species. Furthermore, our new paradigm demonstrates several additional benefits: higher interpretability and interactivity for humans, and the ability to summarize knowledge for a recognition task.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Yan_Learning_Concise_and_Descriptive_Attributes_for_Visual_Recognition_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Rosetta Neurons: Mining the Common Units in a Model Zoo,"Do different neural networks, trained for various vision tasks, share some common representations? In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of common features we call ""Rosetta Neurons"" across a range of models with different architectures, different tasks (generative and discriminative), and different types of supervision (class-supervised, text-supervised, self-supervised). We present an algorithm for mining a dictionary of Rosetta Neurons across several popular vision models: Class Supervised-ResNet50, DINO-ResNet50, DINO-ViT, MAE, CLIP-ResNet50, BigGAN, StyleGAN-2, StyleGAN-XL. Our findings suggest that certain visual concepts and structures are inherently embedded in the natural world and can be learned by different models regardless of the specific task or architecture, and without the use of semantic labels. We can visualize shared concepts directly due to generative models included in our analysis. The Rosetta Neurons facilitate model-to-model translation enabling various inversion-based manipulations, including cross-class alignments, shifting, zooming, and more, without the need for specialized training.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Dravid_Rosetta_Neurons_Mining_the_Common_Units_in_a_Model_Zoo_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Distribution-Aware Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models,"Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) have shown impressive performance on various downstream tasks by utilizing knowledge learned from large data. In general, the performance of VLMs on target tasks can be further improved by prompt tuning, which adds context to the input image or text. By leveraging data from target tasks, various prompt-tuning methods have been studied in the literature. A key to prompt tuning is the feature space alignment between two modalities via learnable vectors with model parameters fixed. We observed that the alignment becomes more effective when embeddings of each modality are 'well-arranged' in the latent space. Inspired by this observation, we proposed distribution-aware prompt tuning (DAPT) for vision-language models, which is simple yet effective. Specifically, the prompts are learned by maximizing inter-dispersion, the distance between classes, as well as minimizing the intra-dispersion measured by the distance between embeddings from the same class. Our extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly improves generalizability. The code is available at https://github.com/mlvlab/DAPT.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Cho_Distribution-Aware_Prompt_Tuning_for_Vision-Language_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html

The model is based on a novel alignment scheme between the visual data and the text, which takes into account both local and global information. Furthermore, the model integrates domain-specific information of two types -- lateral images and the consistent visual structure of chest images. Our representation is shown to benefit three types of retrieval tasks: text-image retrieval, class-based retrieval, and phrase-grounding.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Dawidowicz_LIMITR_Leveraging_Local_Information_for_Medical_Image-Text_Representation_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Generative Action Description Prompts for Skeleton-based Action Recognition,"Skeleton-based action recognition has recently received considerable attention. Current approaches to skeleton-based action recognition are typically formulated as one-hot classification tasks and do not fully exploit the semantic relations between actions. For example, ""make victory sign"" and ""thumb up"" are two actions of hand gestures, whose major difference lies in the movement of hands. This information is agnostic from the categorical one-hot encoding of action classes but could be unveiled from the action description. Therefore, utilizing action description in training could potentially benefit representation learning. In this work, we propose a Generative Action-description Prompts (GAP) approach for skeleton-based action recognition. More specifically, we employ a pre-trained large-scale language model as the knowledge engine to automatically generate text descriptions for body parts movements of actions, and propose a multi-modal training scheme by utilizing the text encoder to generate feature vectors for different body parts and supervise the skeleton encoder for action representation learning. Experiments show that our proposed GAP method achieves noticeable improvements over various baseline models without extra computation cost at inference. GAP achieves new state-of-the-arts on popular skeleton-based action recognition benchmarks, including NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120 and NW-UCLA.

Vision Grid Transformer for Document Layout Analysis,"Document pre-trained models and grid-based models have proven to be very effective on various tasks in Document AI. However, for the document layout analysis (DLA) task, existing document pre-trained models, even those pre-trained in a multi-modal fashion, usually rely on either textual features or visual features. Grid-based models for DLA are multi-modality but largely neglect the effect of pre-training. To fully leverage multi-modal information and exploit pre-training techniques to learn better representation for DLA, in this paper, we present VGT, a two-stream Vision Grid Transformer, in which Grid Transformer (GiT) is proposed and pre-trained for 2D token-level and segment-level semantic understanding. Furthermore, a new dataset named D^4LA, which is so far the most diverse and detailed manually-annotated benchmark for document layout analysis, is curated and released. Experiment results have illustrated that the proposed VGT model achieves new state-of-the-art results on DLA tasks, e.g. PubLayNet (95.7% to 96.2%), DocBank (79.6% to 84.1%), and D^4LA (67.7% to 68.8%). The code and models as well as the D4LA dataset will be made publicly available.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Da_Vision_Grid_Transformer_for_Document_Layout_Analysis_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Video OWL-ViT: Temporally-consistent Open-world Localization in Video,"We present an architecture and a training recipe that adapts pretrained open-world image models to localization in videos. Understanding the open visual world (without being constrained by fixed label spaces) is crucial for many real-world vision tasks. Contrastive pre-training on large image-text datasets has recently led to significant improvements for image-level tasks. For more structured tasks involving object localization applying pre-trained models is more challenging. This is particularly true for video tasks, where task-specific data is limited. We show successful transfer of open-world models by building on the OWL-ViT open-vocabulary detection model and adapting it to video by adding a transformer decoder. The decoder propagates object representations recurrently through time by using the output tokens for one frame as the object queries for the next. Our model is end-to-end trainable on video data and enjoys improved temporal consistency compared to tracking-by-detection baselines, while retaining the open-world capabilities of the backbone detector. We evaluate our model on the challenging TAO-OW benchmark and demonstrate that open-world capabilities, learned from large-scale image-text pretraining, can be transferred successfully to open-world localization across diverse videos.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Heigold_Video_OWL-ViT_Temporally-consistent_Open-world_Localization_in_Video_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Borrowing Knowledge From Pre-trained Language Model: A New Data-efficient Visual Learning Paradigm,"The development of vision models for real-world applications is hindered by the challenge of annotated data scarcity, which has necessitated the adoption of data-efficient visual learning techniques such as semi-supervised learning. Unfortunately, the prevalent cross-entropy supervision is limited by its focus on category discrimination while disregarding the semantic connection between concepts, which ultimately results in the suboptimal exploitation of scarce labeled data. To address this issue, this paper presents a novel approach that seeks to leverage linguistic knowledge for data-efficient visual learning. The proposed approac, BorLan, Borrows knowledge from off-the-shelf pretrained Language models that are already endowed with rich semantics extracted from large corpora, to compensate the semantic deficiency due to limited annotation in visual training. Specifically, we design a distribution alignment objective, which guides the vision model to learn both semantic-aware and domain-agnostic representations for the task through linguistic knowledge. One significant advantage of this paradigm is its flexibility in combining various visual and linguistic models. Extensive experiments on semi-supervised learning, single domain generalization and few-shot learning validate its effectiveness.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Ma_Borrowing_Knowledge_From_Pre-trained_Language_Model_A_New_Data-efficient_Visual_ICCV_2023_paper.html
StylerDALLE: Language-Guided Style Transfer Using a Vector-Quantized Tokenizer of a Large-Scale Generative Model,"Despite the progress made in the style transfer task, most previous work focus on transferring only relatively simple features like color or texture, while missing more abstract concepts such as overall art expression or painter-specific traits. However, these abstract semantics can be captured by models like DALL-E or CLIP, which have been trained using huge datasets of images and textual documents. In this paper, we propose StylerDALLE, a style transfer method that exploits both of these models and uses natural language to describe abstract art styles. Specifically, we formulate the language-guided style transfer task as a non-autoregressive token sequence translation, i.e., from input content image to output stylized image, in the discrete latent space of a large-scale pretrained vector-quantized tokenizer, e.g., the discrete variational auto-encoder (dVAE) of DALL-E. To incorporate style information, we propose a Reinforcement Learning strategy with CLIP-based language supervision that ensures stylization and content preservation simultaneously. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method, which can effectively transfer art styles using language instructions at different granularities.

Weakly-Supervised Text-Driven Contrastive Learning for Facial Behavior Understanding,"Contrastive learning has shown promising potential for learning robust representations by utilizing unlabeled data. 
 However, constructing effective positive-negative pairs for contrastive learning on facial behavior datasets remains challenging. 
 This is because such pairs inevitably encode the subject-ID information, and the randomly constructed pairs may push similar facial images away due to the limited number of subjects in facial behavior datasets.
 To address this issue, we propose to utilize activity descriptions, coarse-grained information provided in some datasets, which can provide high-level semantic information about the image sequences but is often neglected in previous studies.
 More specifically, we introduce a two-stage Contrastive Learning with Text-Embeded framework for Facial behavior understanding (CLEF).
 The first stage is a weakly-supervised contrastive learning method that learns representations from positive-negative pairs constructed using coarse-grained activity information.
 The second stage aims to train the recognition of facial expressions or facial action units by maximizing the similarity between image and the corresponding text label names.
 The proposed CLEF achieves state-of-the-art performance on three in-the-lab datasets for AU recognition and three in-the-wild datasets for facial expression recognition.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhang_Weakly-Supervised_Text-Driven_Contrastive_Learning_for_Facial_Behavior_Understanding_ICCV_2023_paper.html
PRIOR: Prototype Representation Joint Learning from Medical Images and Reports,"Contrastive learning based vision-language joint pre-training has emerged as a successful representation learning strategy. In this paper, we present a prototype representation learning framework incorporating both global and local alignment between medical images and reports. In contrast to standard global multi-modality alignment methods, we employ a local alignment module for fine-grained representation. Furthermore, a cross-modality conditional reconstruction module is designed to interchange information across modalities in the training phase by reconstructing masked images and reports. For reconstructing long reports, a sentence-wise prototype memory bank is constructed, enabling the network to focus on low-level localized visual and high-level clinical linguistic features. Additionally, a non-auto-regressive generation paradigm is proposed for reconstructing non-sequential reports. Experimental results on five downstream tasks, including supervised classification, zero-shot classification, image-to-text retrieval, semantic segmentation, and object detection, show the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods across multiple datasets and under different dataset size settings.

CleanCLIP: Mitigating Data Poisoning Attacks in Multimodal Contrastive Learning,"Multimodal contrastive pretraining has been used to train multimodal representation models, such as CLIP, on large amounts of paired image-text data. However, previous studies have revealed that such models are vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Specifically, when trained on backdoored examples, CLIP learns spurious correlations between the embedded backdoor trigger and the target label, aligning their representations in the joint embedding space. Injecting even a small number of poisoned examples, such as 75 examples in 3 million pretraining data, can significantly manipulate the model's behavior, making it difficult to detect or unlearn such correlations. To address this issue, we propose CleanCLIP, a finetuning framework that weakens the learned spurious associations introduced by backdoor attacks by independently re-aligning the representations for individual modalities. We demonstrate that unsupervised finetuning using a combination of multimodal contrastive and unimodal self-supervised objectives for individual modalities can significantly reduce the impact of the backdoor attack. Additionally, we show that supervised finetuning on task-specific labeled image data removes the backdoor trigger from the CLIP vision encoder. We show empirically that CleanCLIP maintains model performance on benign examples while erasing a range of backdoor attacks on multimodal contrastive learning.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Bansal_CleanCLIP_Mitigating_Data_Poisoning_Attacks_in_Multimodal_Contrastive_Learning_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Improved Visual Fine-tuning with Natural Language Supervision,"Fine-tuning a visual pre-trained model can leverage the semantic information from large-scale pre-training data and mitigate the over-fitting problem on downstream vision tasks with limited training examples. While the problem of catastrophic forgetting in pre-trained backbone has been extensively studied for fine-tuning, its potential bias from the corresponding pre-training task and data, attracts less attention. In this work, we investigate this problem by demonstrating that the obtained classifier after fine-tuning will be close to that induced by the pre-trained model. To reduce the bias in the classifier effectively, we introduce a reference distribution obtained from a fixed text classifier, which can help regularize the learned vision classifier. The proposed method, Text Supervised fine-tuning (TeS), is evaluated with diverse pre-trained vision models including ResNet and ViT, and text encoders including BERT and CLIP, on 11 downstream tasks. The consistent improvement with a clear margin over distinct scenarios confirms the effectiveness of our proposal. Code is available at https://github.com/idstcv/TeS.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wang_Improved_Visual_Fine-tuning_with_Natural_Language_Supervision_ICCV_2023_paper.html
ViLTA: Enhancing Vision-Language Pre-training through Textual Augmentation,"Vision-language pre-training (VLP) methods are blossoming recently, and its crucial goal is to jointly learn visual and textual features via a transformer-based architecture, demonstrating promising improvements on a variety of vision-language tasks. Prior arts usually focus on how to align visual and textual features, but strategies for improving the robustness of model and speeding up model convergence are left insufficiently explored.
 
 In this paper, we propose a novel method ViLTA, comprising of two components to further facilitate the model to learn fine-grained representations among image-text pairs. For Masked Language Modeling (MLM), we propose a cross-distillation method to generate soft labels to enhance the robustness of model, which alleviates the problem of treating synonyms of masked words as negative samples in one-hot labels. For Image-Text Matching (ITM), we leverage the current language encoder to synthesize hard negatives based on the context of language input, encouraging the model to learn high-quality representations by increasing the difficulty of the ITM task. By leveraging the above techniques, our ViLTA can achieve better performance on various vision-language tasks. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that the effectiveness of ViLTA and its promising potential for vision-language pre-training.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wang_ViLTA_Enhancing_Vision-Language_Pre-training_through_Textual_Augmentation_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Teaching CLIP to Count to Ten,"Large vision-language models, such as CLIP, learn robust representations of text and images, facilitating advances in many downstream tasks, including zero-shot classification and text-to-image generation. However, these models have several well-documented limitations. They fail to encapsulate compositional concepts, such as counting. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to extend CLIP to handle object counting. We introduce a simple yet effective method to improve the quantitative understanding of vision-language models, while maintaining their overall performance on common benchmarks.
 Our method automatically augments image captions to create hard negative samples that differ from the original captions by only the number of objects. For example, an image of three dogs can be contrasted with the negative caption ""Six dogs playing in the yard"". A dedicated loss encourages discrimination between the correct caption and its negative variant. 
 In addition, we introduce CountBench, a new benchmark for evaluating a model's understanding of object counting, and demonstrate significant improvement over baseline models on this task. Furthermore, we leverage our improved CLIP representations for text-conditioned image generation, and show that our model can produce specific counts of objects more reliably than existing ones.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Paiss_Teaching_CLIP_to_Count_to_Ten_ICCV_2023_paper.html
A Sentence Speaks a Thousand Images: Domain Generalization through Distilling CLIP with Language Guidance,"Domain generalization studies the problem of training a model with samples from several domains (or distributions) and then testing the model with samples from a new, unseen domain. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for domain generalization that leverages recent advances in large vision-language models, specifically a CLIP teacher model, to train a smaller model that generalizes to unseen domains. The key technical contribution is a new type of regularization that requires the student's learned image representations to be close to the teacher's learned text representations obtained from encoding the corresponding text descriptions of images. We introduce two designs of the loss function, absolute and relative distance, which provide specific guidance on how the training process of the student model should be regularized. We evaluate our proposed method, dubbed RISE (Regularized Invariance with Semantic Embeddings), on various benchmark datasets, and show that it outperforms several state-of-the-art domain generalization methods. To our knowledge, our work is the first to leverage knowledge distillation using a large vision-language model for domain generalization. By incorporating text-based information, RISE improves the generalization capability of machine learning models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Huang_A_Sentence_Speaks_a_Thousand_Images_Domain_Generalization_through_Distilling_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Lip2Vec: Efficient and Robust Visual Speech Recognition via Latent-to-Latent Visual to Audio Representation Mapping,"Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) differs from the common perception tasks as it requires deeper reasoning over the video sequence, even by human experts. Despite the recent advances in VSR, current approaches rely on labeled data to fully train or finetune their models predicting the target speech. This hinders their ability to generalize well beyond the training set and leads to performance degeneration under out-of-distribution challenging scenarios. Un-like previous works that involve auxiliary losses or com-plex training procedures and architectures, we propose a simple approach, named Lip2Vec that is based on learning a prior model. Given a robust visual speech encoder, this network maps the encoded latent representations of the lip sequence to their corresponding latents from the audio pair, which are sufficiently invariant for effective text decoding. The generated audio representation is then decoded to text using an off-the-shelf Audio Speech Recognition (ASR) model. The proposed model compares favorably with fully-supervised learning methods on the LRS3 dataset achieving 26 WER. Unlike SoTA approaches, our model keeps a rea-sonable performance on the VoxCeleb2-en test set. We believe that reprogramming the VSR as an ASR task narrows the performance gap between the two and paves the way for more flexible formulations of lip reading.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Djilali_Lip2Vec_Efficient_and_Robust_Visual_Speech_Recognition_via_Latent-to-Latent_Visual_ICCV_2023_paper.html
CLIPTER: Looking at the Bigger Picture in Scene Text Recognition,"Reading text in real-world scenarios often requires understanding the context surrounding it, especially when dealing with poor-quality text. However, current scene text recognizers are unaware of the bigger picture as they operate on cropped text images. In this study, we harness the representative capabilities of modern vision-language models, such as CLIP, to provide scene-level information to the crop-based recognizer. We achieve this by fusing a rich representation of the entire image, obtained from the vision-language model, with the recognizer word-level features via a gated cross-attention mechanism. This component gradually shifts to the context-enhanced representation, allowing for stable fine-tuning of a pretrained recognizer. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our model-agnostic framework, CLIPTER (CLIP TExt Recognition), on leading text recognition architectures and achieve state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, our analysis highlights improved robustness to out-of-vocabulary words and enhanced generalization in low-data regimes.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Aberdam_CLIPTER_Looking_at_the_Bigger_Picture_in_Scene_Text_Recognition_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Improving CLIP Fine-tuning Performance,"CLIP models have demonstrated impressively high zero-shot recognition accuracy, however, their fine-tuning performance on downstream vision tasks is sub-optimal. Contrarily, masked image modeling (MIM) performs exceptionally for fine-tuning on downstream tasks, despite the absence of semantic labels during training. We note that the two tasks have different ingredients: image-level targets versus token-level targets, a cross-entropy loss versus a regression loss, and full-image inputs versus partial-image inputs. To mitigate the differences, we introduce a classical feature map distillation framework, which can simultaneously inherit the semantic capability of CLIP models while constructing a task incorporated key ingredients of MIM. Experiments suggest that the feature map distillation approach significantly boosts the fine-tuning performance of CLIP models on several typical downstream vision tasks. We also observe that the approach yields new CLIP representations which share some diagnostic properties with those of MIM. Furthermore, the feature map distillation approach generalizes to other pre-training models, such as DINO, DeiT and SwinV2-G, reaching a new record of 64.2 mAP on COCO object detection with +1.1 improvement. The code and mod- els are publicly available at https://github.com/ SwinTransformer/Feature-Distillation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wei_Improving_CLIP_Fine-tuning_Performance_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Linear Spaces of Meanings: Compositional Structures in Vision-Language Models,"We investigate compositional structures in data embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs). Traditionally, compositionality has been associated with algebraic operations on embeddings of words from a pre-existing vocabulary. In contrast, we seek to approximate representations from an encoder as combinations of a smaller set of vectors in the embedding space. These vectors can be seen as ""ideal words"" for generating concepts directly within embedding space of the model. We first present a framework for understanding compositional structures from a geometric perspective. We then explain what these compositional structures entail probabilistically in the case of VLM embeddings, providing intuitions for why they arise in practice. Finally, we empirically explore these structures in CLIP's embeddings and we evaluate their usefulness for solving different vision-language tasks such as classification, debiasing, and retrieval. Our results show that simple linear algebraic operations on embedding vectors can be used as compositional and interpretable methods for regulating the behavior of VLMs.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Trager_Linear_Spaces_of_Meanings_Compositional_Structures_in_Vision-Language_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Audiovisual Masked Autoencoders,"Can we leverage the audiovisual information already present in video to improve self-supervised representation learning? To answer this question, we study various pretraining architectures and objectives within the masked autoencoding framework, motivated by the success of similar methods in natural language and image understanding. We show that we can achieve significant improvements on audiovisual downstream classification tasks, surpassing the state-of-the-art on VGGSound and AudioSet. Furthermore, we can leverage our audiovisual pretraining scheme for multiple unimodal downstream tasks using a single audiovisual pretrained model. We additionally demonstrate the transferability of our representations, achieving state-of-the-art audiovisual results on Epic Kitchens without pretraining specifically for this dataset.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Georgescu_Audiovisual_Masked_Autoencoders_ICCV_2023_paper.html
3D-VisTA: Pre-trained Transformer for 3D Vision and Text Alignment,"3D vision-language grounding (3D-VL) is an emerging field that aims to connect the 3D physical world with natural language, which is crucial for achieving embodied intelligence. Current 3D-VL models rely heavily on sophisticated modules, auxiliary losses, and optimization tricks, which calls for a simple and unified model. In this paper, we propose 3D-VisTA, a pre-trained Transformer for 3D Vis ion and Text Alignment that can be easily adapted to various downstream tasks. 3D-VisTA simply utilizes self-attention layers for both single-modal modeling and multi-modal fusion without any sophisticated task-specific design. To further enhance its performance on 3D-VL tasks, we construct ScanScribe, the first large-scale 3D scene-text pairs dataset for 3D-VL pre-training. ScanScribe contains 2,995 RGB-D scans for 1,185 unique indoor scenes originating from ScanNet and 3R-Scan datasets, along with paired 278K scene descriptions generated from existing 3D-VL tasks, templates, and GPT-3. 3D-VisTA is pre-trained on ScanScribe via masked language/object modeling and scene-text matching. It achieves state-of-the-art results on various 3D-VL tasks, ranging from visual grounding and question answering to situated reasoning. Moreover, 3D-VisTA demonstrates superior data efficiency, obtaining strong performance even with limited annotations during downstream task fine-tuning.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhu_3D-VisTA_Pre-trained_Transformer_for_3D_Vision_and_Text_Alignment_ICCV_2023_paper.html
BUS: Efficient and Effective Vision-Language Pre-Training with Bottom-Up Patch Summarization.,"Vision Transformer (ViT) based Vision-Language Pretraining (VLP) models recently demonstrated impressive performance in various tasks. However, the lengthy visual token sequences used in these models can lead to inefficient and ineffective performance. Existing methods to address these issues lack textual guidance and may overlook crucial visual information related to the text, leading to the introduction of irrelevant information during cross-modal fusion and additional computational cost. In this paper, we propose a Bottom-Up Patch Summarization approach named BUS which is inspired by the Document Summarization Task in NLP to learn a concise visual summary of lengthy visual token sequences, guided by textual semantics. We introduce a Text-Semantic Aware Patch Selector (TAPS) in the ViT backbone to perform a coarse-grained selective visual summarization to over-determine the text-relevant patches, and a light Summarization Decoder to perform fine-grained abstractive summarization based on the selected patches, resulting in a further condensed representation sequence that highlights text-relevant visual semantic information. Such bottom-up process is both efficient and effective with higher performing. We evaluate our approach on various VL understanding and generation tasks and show competitive or better downstream task performance while boosting the efficiency by 50%. Additionally, our model achieves well-designed SOTA downstream task performance by increasing input image resolution without increasing computational costs compared to baselines.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Jiang_BUS_Efficient_and_Effective_Vision-Language_Pre-Training_with_Bottom-Up_Patch_Summarization._ICCV_2023_paper.html
Implicit Neural Representation for Cooperative Low-light Image Enhancement,"The following three factors restrict the application of existing low-light image enhancement methods: unpredictable brightness degradation and noise, inherent gap between metric-favorable and visual-friendly versions, and the limited paired training data. To address these limitations, we propose an implicit Neural Representation method for Cooperative low-light image enhancement, dubbed NeRCo. It robustly recovers perceptual-friendly results in an unsupervised manner. Concretely, NeRCo unifies the diverse degradation factors of real-world scenes with a controllable fitting function, leading to better robustness. In addition, for the output results, we introduce semantic-orientated supervision with priors from the pre-trained vision-language model. Instead of merely following reference images, it encourages results to meet subjective expectations, finding more visual-friendly solutions. Further, to ease the reliance on paired data and reduce solution space, we develop a dual-closed-loop constrained enhancement module. It is trained cooperatively with other affiliated modules in a self-supervised manner. Finally, extensive experiments demonstrate the robustness and superior effectiveness of our proposed NeRCo. Our code is available at https://github.com/Ysz2022/NeRCo.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Yang_Implicit_Neural_Representation_for_Cooperative_Low-light_Image_Enhancement_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Unleashing Text-to-Image Diffusion Models for Visual Perception,"Diffusion models (DMs) have become the new trend of generative models and have demonstrated a powerful ability of conditional synthesis. Among those, text-to-image diffusion models pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs are highly controllable by customizable prompts. Unlike the unconditional generative models that focus on low-level attributes and details, text-to-image diffusion models contain more high-level knowledge thanks to the vision-language pre-training. In this paper, we propose VPD (Visual Perception with pre-trained Diffusion models), a new framework that exploits the semantic information of a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model in visual perception tasks. Instead of using the pre-trained denoising autoencoder in a diffusion-based pipeline, we simply use it as a backbone and aim to study how to take full advantage of the learned knowledge. Specifically, we prompt the denoising decoder with proper textual inputs and refine the text features with an adapter, leading to a better alignment to the pre-trained stage and making the visual contents interact with the text prompts. We also propose to utilize the cross-attention maps between the visual features and the text features to provide explicit guidance. Compared with other pre-training methods, we show that vision-language pre-trained diffusion models can be faster adapted to downstream visual perception tasks using the proposed VPD. Extensive experiments on semantic segmentation, referring image segmentation, and depth estimation demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Notably, VPD attains 0.254 RMSE on NYUv2 depth estimation and 73.3% oIoU on RefCOCO-val referring image segmentation, establishing new records on these two benchmarks.

Unmasked Teacher: Towards Training-Efficient Video Foundation Models,"Video Foundation Models (VFMs) have received limited exploration due to high computational costs and data scarcity. Previous VFMs rely on Image Foundation Models (IFMs), which face challenges in transferring to the video domain. Although VideoMAE has trained a robust ViT from limited data, its low-level reconstruction poses convergence difficulties and conflicts with high-level cross-modal alignment. This paper proposes a training-efficient method for temporal-sensitive VFMs that integrates the benefits of existing methods. To increase data efficiency, we mask out most of the low-semantics video tokens, but selectively align the unmasked tokens with IFM, which serves as the UnMasked Teacher (UMT). By providing semantic guidance, our method enables faster convergence and multimodal friendliness. With a progressive pre-training framework, our model can handle various tasks including scene-related, temporal-related, and complex video-language understanding. Using only public sources for pre-training in 6 days on 32 A100 GPUs, our scratch-built ViT-L/16 achieves state-of-the-art performances on various video tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Li_Unmasked_Teacher_Towards_Training-Efficient_Video_Foundation_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
UniT3D: A Unified Transformer for 3D Dense Captioning and Visual Grounding,"Performing 3D dense captioning and visual grounding requires a common and shared understanding of the underlying multimodal relationships. However, despite some previous attempts on connecting these two related tasks with highly task-specific neural modules, it remains understudied how to explicitly depict their shared nature to learn them simultaneously. In this work, we propose UniT3D, a simple yet effective fully unified transformer-based architecture for jointly solving 3D visual grounding and dense captioning. UniT3D enables learning a strong multimodal representation across the two tasks through a supervised joint pre-training scheme with bidirectional and seq-to-seq objectives. With a generic architecture design, UniT3D allows expanding the pre-training scope to more various training sources such as the synthesized data from 2D prior knowledge to benefit 3D vision-language tasks. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that UniT3D obtains significant gains for 3D dense captioning and visual grounding.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Chen_UniT3D_A_Unified_Transformer_for_3D_Dense_Captioning_and_Visual_ICCV_2023_paper.html
RLIPv2: Fast Scaling of Relational Language-Image Pre-Training,"Relational Language-Image Pre-training (RLIP) aims to align vision representations with relational texts, thereby advancing the capability of relational reasoning in computer vision tasks. However, hindered by the slow convergence of RLIPv1 architecture and the limited availability of existing scene graph data, scaling RLIPv1 is challenging. In this paper, we propose RLIPv2, a fast converging model that enables the scaling of relational pre-training to large-scale pseudo-labelled scene graph data. To enable fast scaling, RLIPv2 introduces Asymmetric Language-Image Fusion (ALIF), a mechanism that facilitates earlier and deeper gated cross-modal fusion with sparsified language encoding layers. ALIF leads to comparable or better performance than RLIPv1 in a fraction of the time for pre-training and fine-tuning. To obtain scene graph data at scale, we extend object detection datasets with free-form relation labels by introducing a captioner (e.g., BLIP) and a designed Relation Tagger. The Relation Tagger assigns BLIP-generated relation texts to region pairs, thus enabling larger-scale relational pre-training. Through extensive experiments conducted on Human-Object Interaction Detection and Scene Graph Generation, RLIPv2 shows state-of-the-art performance on three benchmarks under fully-finetuning, few-shot and zero-shot settings. Notably, the largest RLIPv2 achieves 23.29mAP on HICO-DET without any fine-tuning, yields 32.22mAP with just 1% data and yields 45.09mAP with 100% data.

PreSTU: Pre-Training for Scene-Text Understanding,"The ability to recognize and reason about text embedded in visual inputs is often lacking in vision-and-language (V&L) models, perhaps because V&L pre-training methods have often failed to include such an ability in their training objective. In this paper, we propose PreSTU, a novel pre-training recipe dedicated to scene-text understanding (STU). PreSTU introduces OCR-aware pre-training objectives that encourage the model to recognize text from an image and connect it to the rest of the image content. We implement PreSTU using a simple transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture, combined with large-scale image-text datasets with scene text obtained from an off-the-shelf OCR system. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of this pre-training approach on eight visual question answering and four image captioning benchmarks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Kil_PreSTU_Pre-Training_for_Scene-Text_Understanding_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Task-Oriented Multi-Modal Mutual Leaning for Vision-Language Models,"Prompt learning has become one of the most efficient paradigms for adapting large pre-trained vision-language models to downstream tasks. Current state-of-the-art methods, like CoOp and ProDA, tend to adopt soft prompts to learn an appropriate prompt for each specific task. Recent CoCoOp further boosts the base-to-new generalization performance via an image-conditional prompt. However, it directly fuses identical image semantics to prompts of different labels and significantly weakens the discrimination among different classes as shown in our experiments. Motivated by this observation, we first propose a class-aware text prompt (CTP) to enrich generated prompts with label-related image information. Unlike CoCoOp, CTP can effectively involve image semantics and avoid introducing extra ambiguities into different prompts. On the other hand, instead of reserving the complete image representations, we propose text-guided feature tuning (TFT) to make the image branch attend to class-related representation. A contrastive loss is employed to align such augmented text and image representations on downstream tasks. In this way, the image-to-text CTP and text-to-image TFT can be mutually promoted to enhance the adaptation of VLMs for downstream tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing methods by a significant margin. Especially, compared to CoCoOp, we achieve an average improvement of 4.03% on new classes and 3.19% on harmonic-mean over eleven classification benchmarks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Long_Task-Oriented_Multi-Modal_Mutual_Leaning_for_Vision-Language_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
PatchCT: Aligning Patch Set and Label Set with Conditional Transport for Multi-Label Image Classification,"Multi-label image classification is a prediction task that aims to identify more than one label from a given image. This paper considers the semantic consistency of the latent space between the visual patch and linguistic label domains and introduces the conditional transport (CT) theory to bridge the acknowledged gap. While recent cross-modal attention-based studies have attempted to align such two representations and achieved impressive performance, they required carefully-designed alignment modules and extra complex operations in the attention computation. We find that by formulating the multi-label classification as a CT problem, we can exploit the interactions between the image and label efficiently by minimizing the bidirectional CT cost. Specifically, after feeding the images and textual labels into the modality-specific encoders, we view each image as a mixture of patch embeddings and a mixture of label embeddings, which capture the local region features and the class prototypes, respectively. CT is then employed to learn and align those two semantic sets by defining the forward and backward navigators. Importantly, the defined navigators in CT distance model the similarities between patches and labels, which provides an interpretable tool to visualize the learned prototypes. Extensive experiments on three public image benchmarks show that the proposed model consistently outperforms the previous methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Li_PatchCT_Aligning_Patch_Set_and_Label_Set_with_Conditional_Transport_ICCV_2023_paper.html
