Fast Point Cloud Generation With Straight Flows,"Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful tool for point cloud generation. A key component that drives the impressive performance for generating high-quality samples from noise is iteratively denoise for thousands of steps. While beneficial, the complexity of learning steps has limited its applications to many 3D real-world. To address this limitation, we propose Point Straight Flow (PSF), a model that exhibits impressive performance using one step. Our idea is based on the reformulation of the standard diffusion model, which optimizes the curvy learning trajectory into a straight path. Further, we develop a distillation strategy to shorten the straight path into one step without a performance loss, enabling applications to 3D real-world with latency constraints. We perform evaluations on multiple 3D tasks and find that our PSF performs comparably to the standard diffusion model, outperforming other efficient 3D point cloud generation methods. On real-world applications such as point cloud completion and training-free text-guided generation in a low-latency setup, PSF performs favorably.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wu_Fast_Point_Cloud_Generation_With_Straight_Flows_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Delving Into Shape-Aware Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Thanks to the impressive progress of large-scale vision-language pretraining, recent recognition models can classify arbitrary objects in a zero-shot and open-set manner, with a surprisingly high accuracy. However, translating this success to semantic segmentation is not trivial, because this dense prediction task requires not only accurate semantic understanding but also fine shape delineation and existing vision-language models are trained with image-level language descriptions. To bridge this gap, we pursue shape-aware zero-shot semantic segmentation in this study. Inspired by classical spectral methods in the image segmentation literature, we propose to leverage the eigen vectors of Laplacian matrices constructed with self-supervised pixel-wise features to promote shape-awareness. Despite that this simple and effective technique does not make use of the masks of seen classes at all, we demonstrate that it out-performs a state-of-the-art shape-aware formulation that aligns ground truth and predicted edges during training. We also delve into the performance gains achieved on different datasets using different backbones and draw several interesting and conclusive observations: the benefits of promoting shape-awareness highly relates to mask compactness and language embedding locality. Finally, our method sets new state-of-the-art performance for zero-shot semantic segmentation on both Pascal and COCO, with significant margins. Code and models will be accessed at https://github.com/Liuxinyv/SAZS.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Liu_Delving_Into_Shape-Aware_Zero-Shot_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Variational Distribution Learning for Unsupervised Text-to-Image Generation,"We propose a text-to-image generation algorithm based on deep neural networks when text captions for images are unavailable during training. In this work, instead of simply generating pseudo-ground-truth sentences of training images using existing image captioning methods, we employ a pretrained CLIP model, which is capable of properly aligning embeddings of images and corresponding texts in a joint space and, consequently, works well on zero-shot recognition tasks. We optimize a text-to-image generation model by maximizing the data log-likelihood conditioned on pairs of image-text CLIP embeddings. To better align data in the two domains, we employ a principled way based on a variational inference, which efficiently estimates an approximate posterior of the hidden text embedding given an image and its CLIP feature. Experimental results validate that the proposed framework outperforms existing approaches by large margins under unsupervised and semi-supervised text-to-image generation settings.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Kang_Variational_Distribution_Learning_for_Unsupervised_Text-to-Image_Generation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
"CLIP for All Things Zero-Shot Sketch-Based Image Retrieval, Fine-Grained or Not","In this paper, we leverage CLIP for zero-shot sketch based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR). We are largely inspired by recent advances on foundation models and the unparalleled generalisation ability they seem to offer, but for the first time tailor it to benefit the sketch community. We put forward novel designs on how best to achieve this synergy, for both the category setting and the fine-grained setting (""all""). At the very core of our solution is a prompt learning setup. First we show just via factoring in sketch-specific prompts, we already have a category-level ZS-SBIR system that overshoots all prior arts, by a large margin (24.8%) - a great testimony on studying the CLIP and ZS-SBIR synergy. Moving onto the fine-grained setup is however trickier, and requires a deeper dive into this synergy. For that, we come up with two specific designs to tackle the fine-grained matching nature of the problem: (i) an additional regularisation loss to ensure the relative separation between sketches and photos is uniform across categories, which is not the case for the gold standard standalone triplet loss, and (ii) a clever patch shuffling technique to help establishing instance-level structural correspondences between sketch-photo pairs. With these designs, we again observe significant performance gains in the region of 26.9% over previous state-of-the-art. The take-home message, if any, is the proposed CLIP and prompt learning paradigm carries great promise in tackling other sketch-related tasks (not limited to ZS-SBIR) where data scarcity remains a great challenge.

"Prompt, Generate, Then Cache: Cascade of Foundation Models Makes Strong Few-Shot Learners","Visual recognition in low-data regimes requires deep neural networks to learn generalized representations from limited training samples. Recently, CLIP-based methods have shown promising few-shot performance benefited from the contrastive language-image pre-training. We then question, if the more diverse pre-training knowledge can be cascaded to further assist few-shot representation learning. In this paper, we propose CaFo, a Cascade of Foundation models that incorporates diverse prior knowledge of various pre training paradigms for better few-shot learning. Our CaFo incorporates CLIP's language-contrastive knowledge, DINO's vision-contrastive knowledge, DALL-E's vision generative knowledge, and GPT-3's language-generative knowledge. Specifically, CaFo works by 'Prompt, Generate, then Cache'. Firstly, we leverage GPT-3 to produce textual inputs for prompting CLIP with rich downstream linguistic semantics. Then, we generate synthetic images via DALL-E to expand the few-shot training data without any manpower. At last, we introduce a learnable cache model to adaptively blend the predictions from CLIP and DINO. By such col laboration, CaFo can fully unleash the potential of different pre-training methods and unify them to perform state-of the-art for few-shot classification. Code is available at https://github.com/ZrrSkywalker/CaFo.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zhang_Prompt_Generate_Then_Cache_Cascade_of_Foundation_Models_Makes_Strong_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Visual-Language Prompt Tuning With Knowledge-Guided Context Optimization,"Prompt tuning is an effective way to adapt the pretrained visual-language model (VLM) to the downstream task using task-related textual tokens. Representative CoOp-based works combine the learnable textual tokens with the class tokens to obtain specific textual knowledge. However, the specific textual knowledge has worse generalizable to the unseen classes because it forgets the essential general textual knowledge having a strong generalization ability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a novel Knowledge-guided Context Optimization (KgCoOp) to enhance the generalization ability of the learnable prompt for unseen classes. To remember the essential general knowledge, KgCoOp constructs a regularization term to ensure that the essential general textual knowledge can be embedded into the special textual knowledge generated by the learnable prompt. Especially, KgCoOp minimizes the discrepancy between the textual embeddings generated by learned prompts and the hand-crafted prompts. Finally, adding the KgCoOp upon the contrastive loss can make a discriminative prompt for both seen and unseen tasks. Extensive evaluation of several benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed Knowledge-guided Context Optimization is an efficient method for prompt tuning, i.e., achieves better performance with less training time.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yao_Visual-Language_Prompt_Tuning_With_Knowledge-Guided_Context_Optimization_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning Conditional Attributes for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning,"Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to train models to recognize novel compositional concepts based on learned concepts such as attribute-object combinations. One of the challenges is to model attributes interacted with different objects, e.g., the attribute ""wet"" in ""wet apple"" and ""wet cat"" is different. As a solution, we provide analysis and argue that attributes are conditioned on the recognized object and input image and explore learning conditional attribute embeddings by a proposed attribute learning framework containing an attribute hyper learner and an attribute base learner. By encoding conditional attributes, our model enables to generate flexible attribute embeddings for generalization from seen to unseen compositions. Experiments on CZSL benchmarks, including the more challenging C-GQA dataset, demonstrate better performances compared with other state-of-the-art approaches and validate the importance of learning conditional attributes.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wang_Learning_Conditional_Attributes_for_Compositional_Zero-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Open Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation With Patch Aligned Contrastive Learning,"We introduce Patch Aligned Contrastive Learning (PACL), a modified compatibility function for CLIP's contrastive loss, intending to train an alignment between the patch tokens of the vision encoder and the CLS token of the text encoder. With such an alignment, a model can identify regions of an image corresponding to a given text input, and therefore transfer seamlessly to the task of open vocabulary semantic segmentation without requiring any segmentation annotations during training. Using pre-trained CLIP encoders with PACL, we are able to set the state-of-the-art on the task of open vocabulary zero-shot segmentation on 4 different segmentation benchmarks: Pascal VOC, Pascal Context, COCO Stuff and ADE20K. Furthermore, we show that PACL is also applicable to image-level predictions and when used with a CLIP backbone, provides a general improvement in zero-shot classification accuracy compared to CLIP, across a suite of 12 image classification datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Mukhoti_Open_Vocabulary_Semantic_Segmentation_With_Patch_Aligned_Contrastive_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Bidirectional Cross-Modal Knowledge Exploration for Video Recognition With Pre-Trained Vision-Language Models,"Vision-language models (VLMs) pre-trained on large-scale image-text pairs have demonstrated impressive transferability on various visual tasks. Transferring knowledge from such powerful VLMs is a promising direction for building effective video recognition models. However, current exploration in this field is still limited. We believe that the greatest value of pre-trained VLMs lies in building a bridge between visual and textual domains. In this paper, we propose a novel framework called BIKE, which utilizes the cross-modal bridge to explore bidirectional knowledge: i) We introduce the Video Attribute Association mechanism, which leverages the Video-to-Text knowledge to generate textual auxiliary attributes for complementing video recognition. ii) We also present a Temporal Concept Spotting mechanism that uses the Text-to-Video expertise to capture temporal saliency in a parameter-free manner, leading to enhanced video representation. Extensive studies on six popular video datasets, including Kinetics-400 & 600, UCF-101, HMDB-51, ActivityNet and Charades, show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in various recognition scenarios, such as general, zero-shot, and few-shot video recognition. Our best model achieves a state-of-the-art accuracy of 88.6% on the challenging Kinetics-400 using the released CLIP model.

Pic2Word: Mapping Pictures to Words for Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval,"In Composed Image Retrieval (CIR), a user combines a query image with text to describe their intended target. Existing methods rely on supervised learning of CIR models using labeled triplets consisting of the query image, text specification, and the target image. Labeling such triplets is expensive and hinders broad applicability of CIR. In this work, we propose to study an important task, Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval (ZS-CIR), whose goal is to build a CIR model without requiring labeled triplets for training. To this end, we propose a novel method, called Pic2Word, that requires only weakly labeled image-caption pairs and unlabeled image datasets to train. Unlike existing supervised CIR models, our model trained on weakly labeled or unlabeled datasets shows strong generalization across diverse ZS-CIR tasks, e.g., attribute editing, object composition, and domain conversion. Our approach outperforms several supervised CIR methods on the common CIR benchmark, CIRR and Fashion-IQ.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Saito_Pic2Word_Mapping_Pictures_to_Words_for_Zero-Shot_Composed_Image_Retrieval_CVPR_2023_paper.html
MIANet: Aggregating Unbiased Instance and General Information for Few-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Existing few-shot segmentation methods are based on the meta-learning strategy and extract instance knowledge from a support set and then apply the knowledge to segment target objects in a query set. However, the extracted knowledge is insufficient to cope with the variable intra-class differences since the knowledge is obtained from a few samples in the support set. To address the problem, we propose a multi-information aggregation network (MIANet) that effectively leverages the general knowledge, i.e., semantic word embeddings, and instance information for accurate segmentation. Specifically, in MIANet, a general information module (GIM) is proposed to extract a general class prototype from word embeddings as a supplement to instance information. To this end, we design a triplet loss that treats the general class prototype as an anchor and samples positive-negative pairs from local features in the support set. The calculated triplet loss can transfer semantic similarities among language identities from a word embedding space to a visual representation space. To alleviate the model biasing towards the seen training classes and to obtain multi-scale information, we then introduce a non-parametric hierarchical prior module (HPM) to generate unbiased instance-level information via calculating the pixel-level similarity between the support and query image features. Finally, an information fusion module (IFM) combines the general and instance information to make predictions for the query image. Extensive experiments on PASCAL-5i and COCO-20i show that MIANet yields superior performance and set a new state-of-the-art. Code is available at github.com/Aldrich2y/MIANet.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yang_MIANet_Aggregating_Unbiased_Instance_and_General_Information_for_Few-Shot_Semantic_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning To Name Classes for Vision and Language Models,"Large scale vision and language models can achieve impressive zero-shot recognition performance by mapping class specific text queries to image content. Two distinct challenges that remain however, are high sensitivity to the choice of handcrafted class names that define queries, and the difficulty of adaptation to new, smaller datasets. Towards addressing these problems, we propose to leverage available data to learn, for each class, an optimal word embedding as a function of the visual content. By learning new word embeddings on an otherwise frozen model, we are able to retain zero-shot capabilities for new classes, easily adapt models to new datasets, and adjust potentially erroneous, non-descriptive or ambiguous class names. We show that our solution can easily be integrated in image classification and object detection pipelines, yields significant performance gains in multiple scenarios and provides insights into model biases and labelling errors.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Parisot_Learning_To_Name_Classes_for_Vision_and_Language_Models_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning To Detect and Segment for Open Vocabulary Object Detection,"Open vocabulary object detection has been greately advanced by the recent development of vision-language pre-trained model, which helps recognizing the novel objects with only semantic categories. The prior works mainly focus on knowledge transferring to the object proposal classification and employ class-agnostic box and mask prediction. In this work, we propose CondHead, a principled dynamic network design to better generalize the box regression and mask segmentation for open vocabulary setting. The core idea is to conditionally parametrize the network heads on semantic embedding and thus the model is guided with class-specific knowledge to better detect novel categories. Specifically, CondHead is composed of two streams of network heads, the dynamically aggregated heads and dynamically generated heads. The former is instantiated with a set of static heads that are conditionally aggregated, these heads are optimized as experts and are expected to learn sophisticated prediction. The Latter is instantiated with dynamically generated parameters and encodes general class-specific information. With such conditional design, the detection model is bridged by the semantic embedding to offer strongly generalizable class-wise box and mask prediction. Our method brings significant improvement to the prior state-of-the-art open vocabulary object detection methods with very minor overhead, e.g., it surpasses a RegionClip model by 3.0 detection AP on novel categories, with only 1.1% more computation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wang_Learning_To_Detect_and_Segment_for_Open_Vocabulary_Object_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.html
AutoLabel: CLIP-Based Framework for Open-Set Video Domain Adaptation,"Open-set Unsupervised Video Domain Adaptation (OUVDA) deals with the task of adapting an action recognition model from a labelled source domain to an unlabelled target domain that contains ""target-private"" categories, which are present in the target but absent in the source. In this work we deviate from the prior work of training a specialized open-set classifier or weighted adversarial learning by proposing to use pre-trained Language and Vision Models (CLIP). The CLIP is well suited for OUVDA due to its rich representation and the zero-shot recognition capabilities. However, rejecting target-private instances with the CLIP's zero-shot protocol requires oracle knowledge about the target-private label names. To circumvent the impossibility of the knowledge of label names, we propose AutoLabel that automatically discovers and generates object-centric compositional candidate target-private class names. Despite its simplicity, we show that CLIP when equipped with AutoLabel can satisfactorily reject the target-private instances, thereby facilitating better alignment between the shared classes of the two domains. The code is available.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zara_AutoLabel_CLIP-Based_Framework_for_Open-Set_Video_Domain_Adaptation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Multimodality Helps Unimodality: Cross-Modal Few-Shot Learning With Multimodal Models,"The ability to quickly learn a new task with minimal instruction - known as few-shot learning - is a central aspect of intelligent agents. Classical few-shot benchmarks make use of few-shot samples from a single modality, but such samples may not be sufficient to characterize an entire concept class. In contrast, humans use cross-modal information to learn new concepts efficiently. In this work, we demonstrate that one can indeed build a better visual dog classifier by reading about dogs and listening to them bark. To do so, we exploit the fact that recent multimodal foundation models such as CLIP are inherently cross-modal, mapping different modalities to the same representation space. Specifically, we propose a simple cross-modal adaptation approach that learns from few-shot examples spanning different modalities. By repurposing class names as additional one-shot training samples, we achieve SOTA results with an embarrassingly simple linear classifier for vision-language adaptation. Furthermore, we show that our approach can benefit existing methods such as prefix tuning and classifier ensembling. Finally, to explore other modalities beyond vision and language, we construct the first (to our knowledge) audiovisual few-shot benchmark and use cross-modal training to improve the performance of both image and audio classification. We hope our success can inspire future works to embrace cross-modality for even broader domains and tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Lin_Multimodality_Helps_Unimodality_Cross-Modal_Few-Shot_Learning_With_Multimodal_Models_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Visual Programming: Compositional Visual Reasoning Without Training,"We present VISPROG, a neuro-symbolic approach to solving complex and compositional visual tasks given natural language instructions. VISPROG avoids the need for any task-specific training. Instead, it uses the in-context learning ability of large language models to generate python-like modular programs, which are then executed to get both the solution and a comprehensive and interpretable rationale. Each line of the generated program may invoke one of several off-the-shelf computer vision models, image processing routines, or python functions to produce intermediate outputs that may be consumed by subsequent parts of the program. We demonstrate the flexibility of VISPROG on 4 diverse tasks - compositional visual question answering, zero-shot reasoning on image pairs, factual knowledge object tagging, and language-guided image editing. We believe neuro-symbolic approaches like VISPROG are an exciting avenue to easily and effectively expand the scope of AI systems to serve the long tail of complex tasks that people may wish to perform.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Gupta_Visual_Programming_Compositional_Visual_Reasoning_Without_Training_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Freestyle Layout-to-Image Synthesis,"Typical layout-to-image synthesis (LIS) models generate images for a closed set of semantic classes, e.g., 182 common objects in COCO-Stuff. In this work, we explore the freestyle capability of the model, i.e., how far can it generate unseen semantics (e.g., classes, attributes, and styles) onto a given layout, and call the task Freestyle LIS (FLIS). Thanks to the development of large-scale pre-trained language-image models, a number of discriminative models (e.g., image classification and object detection) trained on limited base classes are empowered with the ability of unseen class prediction. Inspired by this, we opt to leverage large-scale pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models to achieve the generation of unseen semantics. The key challenge of FLIS is how to enable the diffusion model to synthesize images from a specific layout which very likely violates its pre-learned knowledge, e.g., the model never sees ""a unicorn sitting on a bench"" during its pre-training. To this end, we introduce a new module called Rectified Cross-Attention (RCA) that can be conveniently plugged in the diffusion model to integrate semantic masks. This ""plug-in"" is applied in each cross-attention layer of the model to rectify the attention maps between image and text tokens. The key idea of RCA is to enforce each text token to act on the pixels in a specified region, allowing us to freely put a wide variety of semantics from pre-trained knowledge (which is general) onto the given layout (which is specific). Extensive experiments show that the proposed diffusion network produces realistic and freestyle layout-to-image generation results with diverse text inputs, which has a high potential to spawn a bunch of interesting applications. Code is available at https://github.com/essunny310/FreestyleNet.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Xue_Freestyle_Layout-to-Image_Synthesis_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Few-Shot Referring Relationships in Videos,"Interpreting visual relationships is a core aspect of comprehensive video understanding. Given a query visual relationship as <subject, predicate, object> and a test video, our objective is to localize the subject and object that are connected via the predicate. Given modern visio-lingual understanding capabilities, solving this problem is achievable, provided that there are large-scale annotated training examples available. However, annotating for every combination of subject, object, and predicate is cumbersome, expensive, and possibly infeasible. Therefore, there is a need for models that can learn to spatially and temporally localize subjects and objects that are connected via an unseen predicate using only a few support set videos sharing the common predicate. We address this challenging problem, referred to as few-shot referring relationships in videos for the first time. To this end, we pose the problem as a minimization of an objective function defined over a T-partite random field. Here, the vertices of the random field correspond to candidate bounding boxes for the subject and object, and T represents the number of frames in the test video. This objective function is composed of frame level and visual relationship similarity potentials. To learn these potentials, we use a relation network that takes query-conditioned translational relationship embedding as inputs and is meta-trained using support set videos in an episodic manner. Further, the objective function is minimized using a belief propagation-based message passing on the random field to obtain the spatiotemporal localization or subject and object trajectories. We perform extensive experiments using two public benchmarks, namely ImageNet-VidVRD and VidOR, and compare the proposed approach with competitive baselines to assess its efficacy.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Kumar_Few-Shot_Referring_Relationships_in_Videos_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning Attention As Disentangler for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning,"Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims at learning visual concepts (i.e., attributes and objects) from seen compositions and combining concept knowledge into unseen compositions. The key to CZSL is learning the disentanglement of the attribute-object composition. To this end, we propose to exploit cross-attentions as compositional disentanglers to learn disentangled concept embeddings. For example, if we want to recognize an unseen composition ""yellow flower"", we can learn the attribute concept ""yellow"" and object concept ""flower"" from different yellow objects and different flowers respectively. To further constrain the disentanglers to learn the concept of interest, we employ a regularization at the attention level. Specifically, we adapt the earth mover's distance (EMD) as a feature similarity metric in the cross-attention module. Moreover, benefiting from concept disentanglement, we improve the inference process and tune the prediction score by combining multiple concept probabilities. Comprehensive experiments on three CZSL benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms previous works in both closed- and open-world settings, establishing a new state-of-the-art.

GeneCIS: A Benchmark for General Conditional Image Similarity,"We argue that there are many notions of 'similarity' and that models, like humans, should be able to adapt to these dynamically. This contrasts with most representation learning methods, supervised or self-supervised, which learn a fixed embedding function and hence implicitly assume a single notion of similarity. For instance, models trained on ImageNet are biased towards object categories, while a user might prefer the model to focus on colors, textures or specific elements in the scene. In this paper, we propose the GeneCIS ('genesis') benchmark, which measures models' ability to adapt to a range of similarity conditions. Extending prior work, our benchmark is designed for zero-shot evaluation only, and hence considers an open-set of similarity conditions. We find that baselines from powerful CLIP models struggle on GeneCIS and that performance on the benchmark is only weakly correlated with ImageNet accuracy, suggesting that simply scaling existing methods is not fruitful. We further propose a simple, scalable solution based on automatically mining information from existing image-caption datasets. We find our method offers a substantial boost over the baselines on GeneCIS, and further improves zero-shot performance on related image retrieval benchmarks. In fact, though evaluated zero-shot, our model surpasses state-of-the-art supervised models on MIT-States.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Vaze_GeneCIS_A_Benchmark_for_General_Conditional_Image_Similarity_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Zero-Shot Object Counting,"Class-agnostic object counting aims to count object instances of an arbitrary class at test time. It is challenging but also enables many potential applications. Current methods require human-annotated exemplars as inputs which are often unavailable for novel categories, especially for autonomous systems. Thus, we propose zero-shot object counting (ZSC), a new setting where only the class name is available during test time. Such a counting system does not require human annotators in the loop and can operate automatically. Starting from a class name, we propose a method that can accurately identify the optimal patches which can then be used as counting exemplars. Specifically, we first construct a class prototype to select the patches that are likely to contain the objects of interest, namely class-relevant patches. Furthermore, we introduce a model that can quantitatively measure how suitable an arbitrary patch is as a counting exemplar. By applying this model to all the candidate patches, we can select the most suitable patches as exemplars for counting. Experimental results on a recent class-agnostic counting dataset, FSC-147, validate the effectiveness of our method.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Xu_Zero-Shot_Object_Counting_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Multi-Label Compound Expression Recognition: C-EXPR Database & Network,"Research in automatic analysis of facial expressions mainly focuses on recognising the seven basic ones. However, compound expressions are more diverse and represent the complexity and subtlety of our daily affective displays more accurately. Limited research has been conducted for compound expression recognition (CER), because only a few databases exist, which are small, lab controlled, imbalanced and static. In this paper we present an in-the-wild A/V database, C-EXPR-DB, consisting of 400 videos of 200K frames, annotated in terms of 13 compound expressions, valence-arousal emotion descriptors, action units, speech, facial landmarks and attributes. We also propose C-EXPR-NET, a multi-task learning (MTL) method for CER and AU detection (AU-D); the latter task is introduced to enhance CER performance. For AU-D we incorporate AU semantic description along with visual information. For CER we use a multi-label formulation and the KL-divergence loss. We also propose a distribution matching loss for coupling CER and AU-D tasks to boost their performance and alleviate negative transfer (i.e., when MT model's performance is worse than that of at least one single-task model). An extensive experimental study has been conducted illustrating the excellent performance of C-EXPR-NET, validating the theoretical claims. Finally, C-EXPR-NET is shown to effectively generalize its knowledge in new emotion recognition contexts, in a zero-shot manner.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Kollias_Multi-Label_Compound_Expression_Recognition_C-EXPR_Database__Network_CVPR_2023_paper.html
NaQ: Leveraging Narrations As Queries To Supervise Episodic Memory,"Searching long egocentric videos with natural language queries (NLQ) has compelling applications in augmented reality and robotics, where a fluid index into everything that a person (agent) has seen before could augment human memory and surface relevant information on demand. However, the structured nature of the learning problem (free-form text query inputs, localized video temporal window outputs) and its needle-in-a-haystack nature makes it both technically challenging and expensive to supervise. We introduce Narrations-as-Queries (NaQ), a data augmentation strategy that transforms standard video-text narrations into training data for a video query localization model. Validating our idea on the Ego4D benchmark, we find it has tremendous impact in practice. NaQ improves multiple top models by substantial margins (even doubling their accuracy), and yields the very best results to date on the Ego4D NLQ challenge, soundly outperforming all challenge winners in the CVPR and ECCV 2022 competitions and topping the current public leaderboard. Beyond achieving the state-of-the-art for NLQ, we also demonstrate unique properties of our approach such as the ability to perform zero-shot and few-shot NLQ, and improved performance on queries about long-tail object categories.

Detecting Everything in the Open World: Towards Universal Object Detection,"In this paper, we formally address universal object detection, which aims to detect every scene and predict every category. The dependence on human annotations, the limited visual information, and the novel categories in the open world severely restrict the universality of traditional detectors. We propose UniDetector, a universal object detector that has the ability to recognize enormous categories in the open world. The critical points for the universality of UniDetector are: 1) it leverages images of multiple sources and heterogeneous label spaces for training through the alignment of image and text spaces, which guarantees sufficient information for universal representations. 2) it generalizes to the open world easily while keeping the balance between seen and unseen classes, thanks to abundant information from both vision and language modalities. 3) it further promotes the generalization ability to novel categories through our proposed decoupling training manner and probability calibration. These contributions allow UniDetector to detect over 7k categories, the largest measurable category size so far, with only about 500 classes participating in training. Our UniDetector behaves the strong zero-shot generalization ability on large-vocabulary datasets like LVIS, ImageNetBoxes, and VisualGenome - it surpasses the traditional supervised baselines by more than 4% on average without seeing any corresponding images.

Improving Zero-Shot Generalization and Robustness of Multi-Modal Models,"Multi-modal image-text models such as CLIP and LiT have demonstrated impressive performance on image classification benchmarks and their zero-shot generalization ability is particularly exciting. While the top-5 zero-shot accuracies of these models are very high, the top-1 accuracies are much lower (over 25% gap in some cases). We investigate the reasons for this performance gap and find that many of the failure cases are caused by ambiguity in the text prompts. First, we develop a simple and efficient zero-shot post-hoc method to identify images whose top-1 prediction is likely to be incorrect, by measuring consistency of the predictions w.r.t. multiple prompts and image transformations. We show that our procedure better predicts mistakes, outperforming the popular max logit baseline on selective prediction tasks. Next, we propose a simple and efficient way to improve accuracy on such uncertain images by making use of the WordNet hierarchy; specifically we augment the original class by incorporating its parent and children from the semantic label hierarchy, and plug the augmentation into text prompts. We conduct experiments on both CLIP and LiT models with five different ImageNet- based datasets. For CLIP, our method improves the top-1 accuracy by 17.13% on the uncertain subset and 3.6% on the entire ImageNet validation set. We also show that our method improves across ImageNet shifted datasets, four other datasets, and other model architectures such as LiT. Our proposed method is hyperparameter-free, requires no additional model training and can be easily scaled to other large multi-modal architectures. Code is available at https://github.com/gyhandy/Hierarchy-CLIP.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Ge_Improving_Zero-Shot_Generalization_and_Robustness_of_Multi-Modal_Models_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Zero-Shot Generative Model Adaptation via Image-Specific Prompt Learning,"Recently, CLIP-guided image synthesis has shown appealing performance on adapting a pre-trained source-domain generator to an unseen target domain. It does not require any target-domain samples but only the textual domain labels. The training is highly efficient, e.g., a few minutes. However, existing methods still have some limitations in the quality of generated images and may suffer from the mode collapse issue. A key reason is that a fixed adaptation direction is applied for all cross-domain image pairs, which leads to identical supervision signals. To address this issue, we propose an Image-specific Prompt Learning (IPL) method, which learns specific prompt vectors for each source-domain image. This produces a more precise adaptation direction for every cross-domain image pair, endowing the target-domain generator with greatly enhanced flexibility. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations on various domains demonstrate that IPL effectively improves the quality and diversity of synthesized images and alleviates the mode collapse. Moreover, IPL is independent of the structure of the generative model, such as generative adversarial networks or diffusion models. Code is available at https://github.com/Picsart-AI-Research/IPL-Zero-Shot-Generative-Model-Adaptation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Guo_Zero-Shot_Generative_Model_Adaptation_via_Image-Specific_Prompt_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Active Exploration of Multimodal Complementarity for Few-Shot Action Recognition,"Recently, few-shot action recognition receives increasing attention and achieves remarkable progress. However, previous methods mainly rely on limited unimodal data (e.g., RGB frames) while the multimodal information remains relatively underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel Active Multimodal Few-shot Action Recognition (AMFAR) framework, which can actively find the reliable modality for each sample based on task-dependent context information to improve few-shot reasoning procedure. In meta-training, we design an Active Sample Selection (ASS) module to organize query samples with large differences in the reliability of modalities into different groups based on modality-specific posterior distributions. In addition, we design an Active Mutual Distillation (AMD) module to capture discriminative task-specific knowledge from the reliable modality to improve the representation learning of unreliable modality by bidirectional knowledge distillation. In meta-test, we adopt Adaptive Multimodal Inference (AMI) module to adaptively fuse the modality-specific posterior distributions with a larger weight on the reliable modality. Extensive experimental results on four public benchmarks demonstrate that our model achieves significant improvements over existing unimodal and multimodal methods.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wanyan_Active_Exploration_of_Multimodal_Complementarity_for_Few-Shot_Action_Recognition_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Being Comes From Not-Being: Open-Vocabulary Text-to-Motion Generation With Wordless Training,"Text-to-motion generation is an emerging and challenging problem, which aims to synthesize motion with the same semantics as the input text. However, due to the lack of diverse labeled training data, most approaches either limit to specific types of text annotations or require online optimizations to cater to the texts during inference at the cost of efficiency and stability. In this paper, we investigate offline open-vocabulary text-to-motion generation in a zero-shot learning manner that neither requires paired training data nor extra online optimization to adapt for unseen texts. Inspired by the prompt learning in NLP, we pretrain a motion generator that learns to reconstruct the full motion from the masked motion. During inference, instead of changing the motion generator, our method reformulates the input text into a masked motion as the prompt for the motion generator to ""reconstruct"" the motion. In constructing the prompt, the unmasked poses of the prompt are synthesized by a text-to-pose generator. To supervise the optimization of the text-to-pose generator, we propose the first text-pose alignment model for measuring the alignment between texts and 3D poses. And to prevent the pose generator from overfitting to limited training texts, we further propose a novel wordless training mechanism that optimizes the text-to-pose generator without any training texts. The comprehensive experimental results show that our method obtains a significant improvement against the baseline methods.

Language in a Bottle: Language Model Guided Concept Bottlenecks for Interpretable Image Classification,"Concept Bottleneck Models (CBM) are inherently interpretable models that factor model decisions into human-readable concepts. They allow people to easily understand why a model is failing, a critical feature for high-stakes applications. CBMs require manually specified concepts and often under-perform their black box counterparts, preventing their broad adoption. We address these shortcomings and are first to show how to construct high-performance CBMs without manual specification of similar accuracy to black box models. Our approach, Language Guided Bottlenecks (LaBo), leverages a language model, GPT-3, to define a large space of possible bottlenecks. Given a problem domain, LaBo uses GPT-3 to produce factual sentences about categories to form candidate concepts. LaBo efficiently searches possible bottlenecks through a novel submodular utility that promotes the selection of discriminative and diverse information. Ultimately, GPT-3's sentential concepts can be aligned to images using CLIP, to form a bottleneck layer. Experiments demonstrate that LaBo is a highly effective prior for concepts important to visual recognition. In the evaluation with 11 diverse datasets, LaBo bottlenecks excel at few-shot classification: they are 11.7% more accurate than black box linear probes at 1 shot and comparable with more data. Overall, LaBo demonstrates that inherently interpretable models can be widely applied at similar, or better, performance than black box approaches.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yang_Language_in_a_Bottle_Language_Model_Guided_Concept_Bottlenecks_for_CVPR_2023_paper.html
NeRDi: Single-View NeRF Synthesis With Language-Guided Diffusion As General Image Priors,"2D-to-3D reconstruction is an ill-posed problem, yet humans are good at solving this problem due to their prior knowledge of the 3D world developed over years. Driven by this observation, we propose NeRDi, a single-view NeRF synthesis framework with general image priors from 2D diffusion models. Formulating single-view reconstruction as an image-conditioned 3D generation problem, we optimize the NeRF representations by minimizing a diffusion loss on its arbitrary view renderings with a pretrained image diffusion model under the input-view constraint. We leverage off-the-shelf vision-language models and introduce a two-section language guidance as conditioning inputs to the diffusion model. This is essentially helpful for improving multiview content coherence as it narrows down the general image prior conditioned on the semantic and visual features of the single-view input image. Additionally, we introduce a geometric loss based on estimated depth maps to regularize the underlying 3D geometry of the NeRF. Experimental results on the DTU MVS dataset show that our method can synthesize novel views with higher quality even compared to existing methods trained on this dataset. We also demonstrate our generalizability in zero-shot NeRF synthesis for in-the-wild images.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Deng_NeRDi_Single-View_NeRF_Synthesis_With_Language-Guided_Diffusion_As_General_Image_CVPR_2023_paper.html
CLAMP: Prompt-Based Contrastive Learning for Connecting Language and Animal Pose,"Animal pose estimation is challenging for existing image-based methods because of limited training data and large intra- and inter-species variances. Motivated by the progress of visual-language research, we propose that pre-trained language models (eg, CLIP) can facilitate animal pose estimation by providing rich prior knowledge for describing animal keypoints in text. However, we found that building effective connections between pre-trained language models and visual animal keypoints is non-trivial since the gap between text-based descriptions and keypoint-based visual features about animal pose can be significant. To address this issue, we introduce a novel prompt-based Contrastive learning scheme for connecting Language and AniMal Pose (CLAMP) effectively. The CLAMP attempts to bridge the gap by adapting the text prompts to the animal keypoints during network training. The adaptation is decomposed into spatial-aware and feature-aware processes, and two novel contrastive losses are devised correspondingly. In practice, the CLAMP enables the first cross-modal animal pose estimation paradigm. Experimental results show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance under the supervised, few-shot, and zero-shot settings, outperforming image-based methods by a large margin.

"Zero-Shot Everything Sketch-Based Image Retrieval, and in Explainable Style","This paper studies the problem of zero-short sketch-based image retrieval (ZS-SBIR), however with two significant differentiators to prior art (i) we tackle all variants (inter-category, intra-category, and cross datasets) of ZS-SBIR with just one network (""everything""), and (ii) we would really like to understand how this sketch-photo matching operates (""explainable""). Our key innovation lies with the realization that such a cross-modal matching problem could be reduced to comparisons of groups of key local patches -- akin to the seasoned ""bag-of-words"" paradigm. Just with this change, we are able to achieve both of the aforementioned goals, with the added benefit of no longer requiring external semantic knowledge. Technically, ours is a transformer-based cross-modal network, with three novel components (i) a self-attention module with a learnable tokenizer to produce visual tokens that correspond to the most informative local regions, (ii) a cross-attention module to compute local correspondences between the visual tokens across two modalities, and finally (iii) a kernel-based relation network to assemble local putative matches and produce an overall similarity metric for a sketch-photo pair. Experiments show ours indeed delivers superior performances across all ZS-SBIR settings. The all important explainable goal is elegantly achieved by visualizing cross-modal token correspondences, and for the first time, via sketch to photo synthesis by universal replacement of all matched photo patches.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Lin_Zero-Shot_Everything_Sketch-Based_Image_Retrieval_and_in_Explainable_Style_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Side Adapter Network for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation,"This paper presents a new framework for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation with the pre-trained vision-language model, named SAN. Our approach models the semantic segmentation task as a region recognition problem. A side network is attached to a frozen CLIP model with two branches: one for predicting mask proposals, and the other for predicting attention bias which is applied in the CLIP model to recognize the class of masks. This decoupled design has the benefit CLIP in recognizing the class of mask proposals. Since the attached side network can reuse CLIP features, it can be very light. In addition, the entire network can be trained end-to-end, allowing the side network to be adapted to the frozen CLIP model, which makes the predicted mask proposals CLIP-aware. Our approach is fast, accurate, and only adds a few additional trainable parameters. We evaluate our approach on multiple semantic segmentation benchmarks. Our method significantly outperforms other counterparts, with up to 18 times fewer trainable parameters and 19 times faster inference speed. We hope our approach will serve as a solid baseline and help ease future research in open-vocabulary semantic segmentation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Xu_Side_Adapter_Network_for_Open-Vocabulary_Semantic_Segmentation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
PartSLIP: Low-Shot Part Segmentation for 3D Point Clouds via Pretrained Image-Language Models,"Generalizable 3D part segmentation is important but challenging in vision and robotics. Training deep models via conventional supervised methods requires large-scale 3D datasets with fine-grained part annotations, which are costly to collect. This paper explores an alternative way for low-shot part segmentation of 3D point clouds by leveraging a pretrained image-language model, GLIP, which achieves superior performance on open-vocabulary 2D detection. We transfer the rich knowledge from 2D to 3D through GLIP-based part detection on point cloud rendering and a novel 2D-to-3D label lifting algorithm. We also utilize multi-view 3D priors and few-shot prompt tuning to boost performance significantly. Extensive evaluation on PartNet and PartNet-Mobility datasets shows that our method enables excellent zero-shot 3D part segmentation. Our few-shot version not only outperforms existing few-shot approaches by a large margin but also achieves highly competitive results compared to the fully supervised counterpart. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our method can be directly applied to iPhone-scanned point clouds without significant domain gaps.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Liu_PartSLIP_Low-Shot_Part_Segmentation_for_3D_Point_Clouds_via_Pretrained_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Zero-Shot Text-to-Parameter Translation for Game Character Auto-Creation,"Recent popular Role-Playing Games (RPGs) saw the great success of character auto-creation systems. The bone-driven face model controlled by continuous parameters (like the position of bones) and discrete parameters (like the hairstyles) makes it possible for users to personalize and customize in-game characters. Previous in-game character auto-creation systems are mostly image-driven, where facial parameters are optimized so that the rendered character looks similar to the reference face photo. This paper proposes a novel text-to-parameter translation method (T2P) to achieve zero-shot text-driven game character auto-creation. With our method, users can create a vivid in-game character with arbitrary text description without using any reference photo or editing hundreds of parameters manually. In our method, taking the power of large-scale pre-trained multi-modal CLIP and neural rendering, T2P searches both continuous facial parameters and discrete facial parameters in a unified framework. Due to the discontinuous parameter representation, previous methods have difficulty in effectively learning discrete facial parameters. T2P, to our best knowledge, is the first method that can handle the optimization of both discrete and continuous parameters. Experimental results show that T2P can generate high-quality and vivid game characters with given text prompts. T2P outperforms other SOTA text-to-3D generation methods on both objective evaluations and subjective evaluations.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zhao_Zero-Shot_Text-to-Parameter_Translation_for_Game_Character_Auto-Creation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
HOICLIP: Efficient Knowledge Transfer for HOI Detection With Vision-Language Models,"Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. Recently, Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has shown great potential in providing interaction prior for HOI detectors via knowledge distillation. However, such approaches often rely on large-scale training data and suffer from inferior performance under few/zero-shot scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel HOI detection framework that efficiently extracts prior knowledge from CLIP and achieves better generalization. In detail, we first introduce a novel interaction decoder to extract informative regions in the visual feature map of CLIP via a cross-attention mechanism, which is then fused with the detection backbone by a knowledge integration block for more accurate human-object pair detection. In addition, prior knowledge in CLIP text encoder is leveraged to generate a classifier by embedding HOI descriptions. To distinguish fine-grained interactions, we build a verb classifier from training data via visual semantic arithmetic and a lightweight verb representation adapter. Furthermore, we propose a training-free enhancement to exploit global HOI predictions from CLIP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the state of the art by a large margin on various settings, e.g. +4.04 mAP on HICO-Det.

Open-Vocabulary Attribute Detection,"Vision-language modeling has enabled open-vocabulary tasks where predictions can be queried using any text prompt in a zero-shot manner. Existing open-vocabulary tasks focus on object classes, whereas research on object attributes is limited due to the lack of a reliable attribute-focused evaluation benchmark. This paper introduces the Open-Vocabulary Attribute Detection (OVAD) task and the corresponding OVAD benchmark. The objective of the novel task and benchmark is to probe object-level attribute information learned by vision-language models. To this end, we created a clean and densely annotated test set covering 117 attribute classes on the 80 object classes of MS COCO. It includes positive and negative annotations, which enables open-vocabulary evaluation. Overall, the benchmark consists of 1.4 million annotations. For reference, we provide a first baseline method for open-vocabulary attribute detection. Moreover, we demonstrate the benchmark's value by studying the attribute detection performance of several foundation models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Bravo_Open-Vocabulary_Attribute_Detection_CVPR_2023_paper.html
OpenScene: 3D Scene Understanding With Open Vocabularies,"Traditional 3D scene understanding approaches rely on labeled 3D datasets to train a model for a single task with supervision. We propose OpenScene, an alternative approach where a model predicts dense features for 3D scene points that are co-embedded with text and image pixels in CLIP feature space. This zero-shot approach enables task-agnostic training and open-vocabulary queries. For example, to perform SOTA zero-shot 3D semantic segmentation it first infers CLIP features for every 3D point and later classifies them based on similarities to embeddings of arbitrary class labels. More interestingly, it enables a suite of open-vocabulary scene understanding applications that have never been done before. For example, it allows a user to enter an arbitrary text query and then see a heat map indicating which parts of a scene match. Our approach is effective at identifying objects, materials, affordances, activities, and room types in complex 3D scenes, all using a single model trained without any labeled 3D data.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Peng_OpenScene_3D_Scene_Understanding_With_Open_Vocabularies_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Primitive Generation and Semantic-Related Alignment for Universal Zero-Shot Segmentation,"We study universal zero-shot segmentation in this work to achieve panoptic, instance, and semantic segmentation for novel categories without any training samples. Such zero-shot segmentation ability relies on inter-class relationships in semantic space to transfer the visual knowledge learned from seen categories to unseen ones. Thus, it is desired to well bridge semantic-visual spaces and apply the semantic relationships to visual feature learning. We introduce a generative model to synthesize features for unseen categories, which links semantic and visual spaces as well as address the issue of lack of unseen training data. Furthermore, to mitigate the domain gap between semantic and visual spaces, firstly, we enhance the vanilla generator with learned primitives, each of which contains fine-grained attributes related to categories, and synthesize unseen features by selectively assembling these primitives. Secondly, we propose to disentangle the visual feature into the semantic-related part and the semantic-unrelated part that contains useful visual classification clues but is less relevant to semantic representation. The inter-class relationships of semantic-related visual features are then required to be aligned with those in semantic space, thereby transferring semantic knowledge to visual feature learning. The proposed approach achieves impressively state-of-the-art performance on zero-shot panoptic segmentation, instance segmentation, and semantic segmentation.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/He_Primitive_Generation_and_Semantic-Related_Alignment_for_Universal_Zero-Shot_Segmentation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
(ML)$^2$P-Encoder: On Exploration of Channel-Class Correlation for Multi-Label Zero-Shot Learning,"Recent studies usually approach multi-label zero-shot learning (MLZSL) with visual-semantic mapping on spatial-class correlation, which can be computationally costly, and worse still, fails to capture fine-grained class-specific semantics. We observe that different channels may usually have different sensitivities on classes, which can correspond to specific semantics. Such an intrinsic channel-class correlation suggests a potential alternative for the more accurate and class-harmonious feature representations. In this paper, our interest is to fully explore the power of channel-class correlation as the unique base for MLZSL. Specifically, we propose a light yet efficient Multi-Label Multi-Layer Perceptron-based Encoder, dubbed (ML)^2P-Encoder, to extract and preserve channel-wise semantics. We reorganize the generated feature maps into several groups, of which each of them can be trained independently with (ML)^2P-Encoder. On top of that, a global group-wise attention module is further designed to build the multi-label specific class relationships among different classes, which eventually fulfills a novel Channel-Class Correlation MLZSL framework (C^3-MLZSL). Extensive experiments on large-scale MLZSL benchmarks including NUS-WIDE and Open-Images-V4 demonstrate the superiority of our model against other representative state-of-the-art models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Liu_ML2P-Encoder_On_Exploration_of_Channel-Class_Correlation_for_Multi-Label_Zero-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Shifted Diffusion for Text-to-Image Generation,"We present Corgi, a novel method for text-to-image generation. Corgi is based on our proposed shifted diffusion model, which achieves better image embedding generation from input text. Different from the baseline diffusion model used in DALL-E 2, our method seamlessly encodes prior knowledge of the pre-trained CLIP model in its diffusion process by designing a new initialization distribution and a new transition step of the diffusion. Compared to the strong DALL-E 2 baseline, our method performs better in generating image embedding from the text in terms of both efficiency and effectiveness, which consequently results in better text-to-image generation. Extensive large-scale experiments are conducted and evaluated in terms of both quantitative measures and human evaluation, indicating a stronger generation ability of our method compared to existing ones. Furthermore, our model enables semi-supervised and language-free training for text-to-image generation, where only part or none of the images in the training dataset have an associated caption. Trained with only 1.7% of the images being captioned, our semi-supervised model obtains FID results comparable to DALL-E 2 on zero-shot text-to-image generation evaluated on MS-COCO. Corgi also achieves new state-of-the-art results across different datasets on downstream language-free text-to-image generation tasks, outperforming the previous method, Lafite, by a large margin.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Zhou_Shifted_Diffusion_for_Text-to-Image_Generation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation for Zero-Shot Instance Segmentation,"Zero-shot instance segmentation aims to detect and precisely segment objects of unseen categories without any training samples. Since the model is trained on seen categories, there is a strong bias that the model tends to classify all the objects into seen categories. Besides, there is a natural confusion between background and novel objects that have never shown up in training. These two challenges make novel objects hard to be raised in the final instance segmentation results. It is desired to rescue novel objects from background and dominated seen categories. To this end, we propose D^2Zero with Semantic-Promoted Debiasing and Background Disambiguation to enhance the performance of Zero-shot instance segmentation. Semantic-promoted debiasing utilizes inter-class semantic relationships to involve unseen categories in visual feature training and learns an input-conditional classifier to conduct dynamical classification based on the input image. Background disambiguation produces image-adaptive background representation to avoid mistaking novel objects for background. Extensive experiments show that we significantly outperform previous state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, e.g., 16.86% improvement on COCO.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/He_Semantic-Promoted_Debiasing_and_Background_Disambiguation_for_Zero-Shot_Instance_Segmentation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Learning To Generate Text-Grounded Mask for Open-World Semantic Segmentation From Only Image-Text Pairs,"We tackle open-world semantic segmentation, which aims at learning to segment arbitrary visual concepts in images, by using only image-text pairs without dense annotations. Existing open-world segmentation methods have shown impressive advances by employing contrastive learning (CL) to learn diverse visual concepts and transferring the learned image-level understanding to the segmentation task. However, these CL-based methods suffer from a train-test discrepancy, since it only considers image-text alignment during training, whereas segmentation requires region-text alignment during testing. In this paper, we proposed a novel Text-grounded Contrastive Learning (TCL) framework that enables a model to directly learn region-text alignment. Our method generates a segmentation mask for a given text, extracts text-grounded image embedding from the masked region, and aligns it with text embedding via TCL. By learning region-text alignment directly, our framework encourages a model to directly improve the quality of generated segmentation masks. In addition, for a rigorous and fair comparison, we present a unified evaluation protocol with widely used 8 semantic segmentation datasets. TCL achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot segmentation performances with large margins in all datasets.

Visual Language Pretrained Multiple Instance Zero-Shot Transfer for Histopathology Images,"Contrastive visual language pretraining has emerged as a powerful method for either training new language-aware image encoders or augmenting existing pretrained models with zero-shot visual recognition capabilities. However, existing works typically train on large datasets of image-text pairs and have been designed to perform downstream tasks involving only small to medium sized-images, neither of which are applicable to the emerging field of computational pathology where there are limited publicly available paired image-text datasets and each image can span up to 100,000 x 100,000 pixels in dimensions. In this paper we present MI-Zero, a simple and intuitive framework for unleashing the zero-shot transfer capabilities of contrastively aligned image and text models to gigapixel histopathology whole slide images, enabling multiple downstream diagnostic tasks to be carried out by pretrained encoders without requiring any additional labels. MI-Zero reformulates zero-shot transfer under the framework of multiple instance learning to overcome the computational challenge of inference on extremely large images. We used over 550k pathology reports and other available in-domain text corpora to pretrain our text encoder. By effectively leveraging strong pretrained encoders, our best model pretrained on over 33k histopathology image-caption pairs achieves an average median zero-shot accuracy of 70.2% across three different real-world cancer subtyping tasks.

Few-Shot Semantic Image Synthesis With Class Affinity Transfer,"Semantic image synthesis aims to generate photo realistic images given a semantic segmentation map. Despite much recent progress, training them still requires large datasets of images annotated with per-pixel label maps that are extremely tedious to obtain. To alleviate the high annotation cost, we propose a transfer method that leverages a model trained on a large source dataset to improve the learning ability on small target datasets via estimated pairwise relations between source and target classes. The class affinity matrix is introduced as a first layer to the source model to make it compatible with the target label maps, and the source model is then further fine-tuned for the target domain. To estimate the class affinities we consider different approaches to leverage prior knowledge: semantic segmentation on the source domain, textual label embeddings, and self-supervised vision features. We apply our approach to GAN-based and diffusion-based architectures for semantic synthesis. Our experiments show that the different ways to estimate class affinity can effectively combined, and that our approach significantly improves over existing state-of-the-art transfer approaches for generative image models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Careil_Few-Shot_Semantic_Image_Synthesis_With_Class_Affinity_Transfer_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Specialist Diffusion: Plug-and-Play Sample-Efficient Fine-Tuning of Text-to-Image Diffusion Models To Learn Any Unseen Style,"Diffusion models have demonstrated impressive capability of text-conditioned image synthesis, and broader application horizons are emerging by personalizing those pretrained diffusion models toward generating some specialized target object or style. In this paper, we aim to learn an unseen style by simply fine-tuning a pre-trained diffusion model with a handful of images (e.g., less than 10), so that the fine-tuned model can generate high-quality images of arbitrary objects in this style. Such extremely lowshot fine-tuning is accomplished by a novel toolkit of finetuning techniques, including text-to-image customized data augmentations, a content loss to facilitate content-style disentanglement, and sparse updating that focuses on only a few time steps. Our framework, dubbed Specialist Diffusion, is plug-and-play to existing diffusion model backbones and other personalization techniques. We demonstrate it to outperform the latest few-shot personalization alternatives of diffusion models such as Textual Inversion and DreamBooth, in terms of learning highly sophisticated styles with ultra-sample-efficient tuning. We further show that Specialist Diffusion can be integrated on top of textual inversion to boost performance further, even on highly unusual styles.

ZegCLIP: Towards Adapting CLIP for Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, CLIP has been applied to pixel-level zero-shot learning tasks via a wo-stage scheme. The general idea is to first generate class-agnostic region proposals and then feed the cropped proposal regions to CLIP to utilize its image-level zero-shot classification capability. While effective, such a scheme requires two image encoders, one for proposal generation and one for CLIP, leading to a complicated pipeline and high computational cost. In this work, we pursue a simpler-and-efficient one-stage solution that directly extends CLIP's zero-shot prediction capability from image to pixel level. Our investigation starts with a straightforward extension as our baseline that generates semantic masks by comparing the similarity between text and patch embeddings extracted from CLIP. However, such a paradigm could heavily overfit the seen classes and fail to generalize to unseen classes. To handle this issue, we propose three simple-but-effective designs and figure out that they can significantly retain the inherent zero-shot capacity of CLIP and improve pixel-level generalization ability. Incorporating those modifications leads to an efficient zero-shot semantic segmentation system called ZegCLIP. Through extensive experiments on three public benchmarks, ZegCLIP demonstrates superior performance, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a large margin under both ""inductive"" and ""transductive"" zero-shot settings. In addition, compared with the two-stage method, our one-stage ZegCLIP achieves a speedup of about 5 times faster during inference.

CLIP-Sculptor: Zero-Shot Generation of High-Fidelity and Diverse Shapes From Natural Language,"Recent works have demonstrated that natural language can be used to generate and edit 3D shapes. However, these methods generate shapes with limited fidelity and diversity. We introduce CLIP-Sculptor, a method to address these constraints by producing high-fidelity and diverse 3D shapes without the need for (text, shape) pairs during training. CLIP-Sculptor achieves this in a multi-resolution approach that first generates in a low-dimensional latent space and then upscales to a higher resolution for improved shape fidelity. For improved shape diversity, we use a discrete latent space which is modeled using a transformer conditioned on CLIP's image-text embedding space. We also present a novel variant of classifier-free guidance, which improves the accuracy-diversity trade-off. Finally, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating that CLIP-Sculptor outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Sanghi_CLIP-Sculptor_Zero-Shot_Generation_of_High-Fidelity_and_Diverse_Shapes_From_Natural_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Decomposed Soft Prompt Guided Fusion Enhancing for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning,"Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel concepts formed by known states and objects during training. Existing methods either learn the combined state-object representation, challenging the generalization of unseen compositions, or design two classifiers to identify state and object separately from image features, ignoring the intrinsic relationship between them. To jointly eliminate the above issues and construct a more robust CZSL system, we propose a novel framework termed Decomposed Fusion with Soft Prompt (DFSP), by involving vision-language models (VLMs) for unseen composition recognition. Specifically, DFSP constructs a vector combination of learnable soft prompts with state and object to establish the joint representation of them. In addition, a cross-modal decomposed fusion module is designed between the language and image branches, which decomposes state and object among language features instead of image features. Notably, being fused with the decomposed features, the image features can be more expressive for learning the relationship with states and objects, respectively, to improve the response of unseen compositions in the pair space, hence narrowing the domain gap between seen and unseen sets. Experimental results on three challenging benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art methods by large margins.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Lu_Decomposed_Soft_Prompt_Guided_Fusion_Enhancing_for_Compositional_Zero-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html
AVFormer: Injecting Vision Into Frozen Speech Models for Zero-Shot AV-ASR,"Audiovisual automatic speech recognition (AV-ASR) aims to improve the robustness of a speech recognition system by incorporating visual information. Training fully supervised multimodal models for this task from scratch, however is limited by the need for large labelled audiovisual datasets (in each downstream domain of interest). We present AVFormer, a simple method for augmenting audioonly models with visual information, at the same time performing lightweight domain adaptation. We do this by (i) injecting visual embeddings into a frozen ASR model using lightweight trainable adaptors. We show that these can be trained on a small amount of weakly labelled video data with minimum additional training time and parameters. (ii) We also introduce a simple curriculum scheme during training which we show is crucial to enable the model to jointly process audio and visual information effectively; and finally (iii) we show that our model achieves state of the art zero-shot results on three different AV-ASR benchmarks (How2, VisSpeech and Ego4D), while also crucially preserving decent performance on traditional audio-only speech recognition benchmarks (LibriSpeech). Qualitative results show that our model effectively leverages visual information for robust speech recognition.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Seo_AVFormer_Injecting_Vision_Into_Frozen_Speech_Models_for_Zero-Shot_AV-ASR_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Zero-Shot Model Diagnosis,"When it comes to deploying deep vision models, the behavior of these systems must be explicable to ensure confidence in their reliability and fairness. A common approach to evaluate deep learning models is to build a labeled test set with attributes of interest and assess how well it performs. However, creating a balanced test set (i.e., one that is uniformly sampled over all the important traits) is often time-consuming, expensive, and prone to mistakes. The question we try to address is: can we evaluate the sensitivity of deep learning models to arbitrary visual attributes without an annotated test set? This paper argues the case that Zero-shot Model Diagnosis (ZOOM) is possible without the need for a test set nor labeling. To avoid the need for test sets, our system relies on a generative model and CLIP. The key idea is enabling the user to select a set of prompts (relevant to the problem) and our system will automatically search for semantic counterfactual images (i.e., synthesized images that flip the prediction in the case of a binary classifier) using the generative model. We evaluate several visual tasks (classification, key-point detection, and segmentation) in multiple visual domains to demonstrate the viability of our methodology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method is capable of producing counterfactual images and offering sensitivity analysis for model diagnosis without the need for a test set.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Luo_Zero-Shot_Model_Diagnosis_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Master: Meta Style Transformer for Controllable Zero-Shot and Few-Shot Artistic Style Transfer,"Transformer-based models achieve favorable performance in artistic style transfer recently thanks to its global receptive field and powerful multi-head/layer attention operations. Nevertheless, the over-paramerized multi-layer structure increases parameters significantly and thus presents a heavy burden for training. Moreover, for the task of style transfer, vanilla Transformer that fuses content and style features by residual connections is prone to content-wise distortion. In this paper, we devise a novel Transformer model termed as Master specifically for style transfer. On the one hand, in the proposed model, different Transformer layers share a common group of parameters, which (1) reduces the total number of parameters, (2) leads to more robust training convergence, and (3) is readily to control the degree of stylization via tuning the number of stacked layers freely during inference. On the other hand, different from the vanilla version, we adopt a learnable scaling operation on content features before content-style feature interaction, which better preserves the original similarity between a pair of content features while ensuring the stylization quality. We also propose a novel meta learning scheme for the proposed model so that it can not only work in the typical setting of arbitrary style transfer, but also adaptable to the few-shot setting, by only fine-tuning the Transformer encoder layer in the few-shot stage for one specific style. Text-guided few-shot style transfer is firstly achieved with the proposed framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of Master under both zero-shot and few-shot style transfer settings.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Tang_Master_Meta_Style_Transformer_for_Controllable_Zero-Shot_and_Few-Shot_Artistic_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Local 3D Editing via 3D Distillation of CLIP Knowledge,"3D content manipulation is an important computer vision task with many real-world applications (e.g., product design, cartoon generation, and 3D Avatar editing). Recently proposed 3D GANs can generate diverse photo-realistic 3D-aware contents using Neural Radiance fields (NeRF). However, manipulation of NeRF still remains a challenging problem since the visual quality tends to degrade after manipulation and suboptimal control handles such as semantic maps are used for manipulations. While text-guided manipulations have shown potential in 3D editing, such approaches often lack locality. To overcome the problems, we propose Local Editing NeRF (LENeRF), which only requires text inputs for fine-grained and localized manipulation. Specifically, we present three add-on modules of LENeRF, the Latent Residual Mapper, the Attention Field Network, and the Deformation Network, which are jointly used for local manipulations of 3D features by estimating a 3D attention field. The 3D attention field is learned in an unsupervised way, by distilling the CLIP's zero-shot mask generation capability to 3D with multi-view guidance. We conduct diverse experiments and thorough evaluations both quantitatively and qualitatively.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Hyung_Local_3D_Editing_via_3D_Distillation_of_CLIP_Knowledge_CVPR_2023_paper.html
"Gazeformer: Scalable, Effective and Fast Prediction of Goal-Directed Human Attention","Predicting human gaze is important in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI). However, to practically serve HCI applications, gaze prediction models must be scalable, fast, and accurate in their spatial and temporal gaze predictions. Recent scanpath prediction models focus on goal-directed attention (search). Such models are limited in their application due to a common approach relying on trained target detectors for all possible objects, and the availability of human gaze data for their training (both not scalable). In response, we pose a new task called ZeroGaze, a new variant of zero-shot learning where gaze is predicted for never-before-searched objects, and we develop a novel model, Gazeformer, to solve the ZeroGaze problem. In contrast to existing methods using object detector modules, Gazeformer encodes the target using a natural language model, thus leveraging semantic similarities in scanpath prediction. We use a transformer-based encoder-decoder architecture because transformers are particularly useful for generating contextual representations. Gazeformer surpasses other models by a large margin (19% - 70%) on the ZeroGaze setting. It also outperforms existing target-detection models on standard gaze prediction for both target-present and target-absent search tasks. In addition to its improved performance, Gazeformer is more than five times faster than the state-of-the-art target-present visual search model.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Mondal_Gazeformer_Scalable_Effective_and_Fast_Prediction_of_Goal-Directed_Human_Attention_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Vita-CLIP: Video and Text Adaptive CLIP via Multimodal Prompting,"Adopting contrastive image-text pretrained models like CLIP towards video classification has gained attention due to its cost-effectiveness and competitive performance. However, recent works in this area face a trade-off. Finetuning the pretrained model to achieve strong supervised performance results in low zero-shot generalization. Similarly, freezing the backbone to retain zero-shot capability causes significant drop in supervised accuracy. Because of this, recent works in literature typically train separate models for supervised and zero-shot action recognition. In this work, we propose a multimodal prompt learning scheme that works to balance the supervised and zero-shot performance under a single unified training. Our prompting approach on the vision side caters for three aspects: 1) Global video-level prompts to model the data distribution; 2) Local frame-level prompts to provide per-frame discriminative conditioning; and 3) a summary prompt to extract a condensed video representation. Additionally, we define a prompting scheme on the text side to augment the textual context. Through this prompting scheme, we can achieve state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on Kinetics-600, HMDB51 and UCF101 while remaining competitive in the supervised setting. By keeping the pretrained backbone frozen, we optimize a much lower number of parameters and retain the existing general representation which helps achieve the strong zero-shot performance. Our codes and models will be publicly released.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wasim_Vita-CLIP_Video_and_Text_Adaptive_CLIP_via_Multimodal_Prompting_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Progressive Semantic-Visual Mutual Adaption for Generalized Zero-Shot Learning,"Generalized Zero-Shot Learning (GZSL) identifies unseen categories by knowledge transferred from the seen domain, relying on the intrinsic interactions between visual and semantic information. Prior works mainly localize regions corresponding to the sharing attributes. When various visual appearances correspond to the same attribute, the sharing attributes inevitably introduce semantic ambiguity, hampering the exploration of accurate semantic-visual interactions. In this paper, we deploy the dual semantic-visual transformer module (DSVTM) to progressively model the correspondences between attribute prototypes and visual features, constituting a progressive semantic-visual mutual adaption (PSVMA) network for semantic disambiguation and knowledge transferability improvement. Specifically, DSVTM devises an instance-motivated semantic encoder that learns instance-centric prototypes to adapt to different images, enabling the recast of the unmatched semantic-visual pair into the matched one. Then, a semantic-motivated instance decoder strengthens accurate cross-domain interactions between the matched pair for semantic-related instance adaption, encouraging the generation of unambiguous visual representations. Moreover, to mitigate the bias towards seen classes in GZSL, a debiasing loss is proposed to pursue response consistency between seen and unseen predictions. The PSVMA consistently yields superior performances against other state-of-the-art methods. Code will be available at: https://github.com/ManLiuCoder/PSVMA.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Liu_Progressive_Semantic-Visual_Mutual_Adaption_for_Generalized_Zero-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html
WinCLIP: Zero-/Few-Shot Anomaly Classification and Segmentation,"Visual anomaly classification and segmentation are vital for automating industrial quality inspection. The focus of prior research in the field has been on training custom models for each quality inspection task, which requires task-specific images and annotation. In this paper we move away from this regime, addressing zero-shot and few-normal-shot anomaly classification and segmentation. Recently CLIP, a vision-language model, has shown revolutionary generality with competitive zero/few-shot performance in comparison to full-supervision. But CLIP falls short on anomaly classification and segmentation tasks. Hence, we propose window-based CLIP (WinCLIP) with (1) a compositional ensemble on state words and prompt templates and (2) efficient extraction and aggregation of window/patch/image-level features aligned with text. We also propose its few-normal-shot extension WinCLIP+, which uses complementary information from normal images. In MVTec-AD (and VisA), without further tuning, WinCLIP achieves 91.8%/85.1% (78.1%/79.6%) AUROC in zero-shot anomaly classification and segmentation while WinCLIP+ does 93.1%/95.2% (83.8%/96.4%) in 1-normal-shot, surpassing state-of-the-art by large margins.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Jeong_WinCLIP_Zero-Few-Shot_Anomaly_Classification_and_Segmentation_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Dream3D: Zero-Shot Text-to-3D Synthesis Using 3D Shape Prior and Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Recent CLIP-guided 3D optimization methods, such as DreamFields and PureCLIPNeRF, have achieved impressive results in zero-shot text-to-3D synthesis. However, due to scratch training and random initialization without prior knowledge, these methods often fail to generate accurate and faithful 3D structures that conform to the input text. In this paper, we make the first attempt to introduce explicit 3D shape priors into the CLIP-guided 3D optimization process. Specifically, we first generate a high-quality 3D shape from the input text in the text-to-shape stage as a 3D shape prior. We then use it as the initialization of a neural radiance field and optimize it with the full prompt. To address the challenging text-to-shape generation task, we present a simple yet effective approach that directly bridges the text and image modalities with a powerful text-to-image diffusion model. To narrow the style domain gap between the images synthesized by the text-to-image diffusion model and shape renderings used to train the image-to-shape generator, we further propose to jointly optimize a learnable text prompt and fine-tune the text-to-image diffusion model for rendering-style image generation. Our method, Dream3D, is capable of generating imaginative 3D content with superior visual quality and shape accuracy compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Texts as Images in Prompt Tuning for Multi-Label Image Recognition,"Prompt tuning has been employed as an efficient way to adapt large vision-language pre-trained models (e.g. CLIP) to various downstream tasks in data-limited or label-limited settings. Nonetheless, visual data (e.g., images) is by default prerequisite for learning prompts in existing methods. In this work, we advocate that the effectiveness of image-text contrastive learning in aligning the two modalities (for training CLIP) further makes it feasible to treat texts as images for prompt tuning and introduce TaI prompting. In contrast to the visual data, text descriptions are easy to collect, and their class labels can be directly derived. Particularly, we apply TaI prompting to multi-label image recognition, where sentences in the wild serve as alternatives to images for prompt tuning. Moreover, with TaI, double-grained prompt tuning (TaI-DPT) is further presented to extract both coarse-grained and fine-grained embeddings for enhancing the multi-label recognition performance. Experimental results show that our proposed TaI-DPT outperforms zero-shot CLIP by a large margin on multiple benchmarks, e.g., MS-COCO, VOC2007, and NUS-WIDE, while it can be combined with existing methods of prompting from images to improve recognition performance further. The code is released at https://github.com/guozix/TaI-DPT.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Guo_Texts_as_Images_in_Prompt_Tuning_for_Multi-Label_Image_Recognition_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Finetune Like You Pretrain: Improved Finetuning of Zero-Shot Vision Models,"Finetuning image-text models such as CLIP achieves state-of-the-art accuracies on a variety of benchmarks. However, recent works (Kumar et al., 2022; Wortsman et al., 2021) have shown that even subtle differences in the finetuning process can lead to surprisingly large differences in the final performance, both for in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) data. In this work, we show that a natural and simple approach of mimicking contrastive pretraining consistently outperforms alternative finetuning approaches. Specifically, we cast downstream class labels as text prompts and continue optimizing the contrastive loss between image embeddings and class-descriptive prompt embeddings (contrastive finetuning). Our method consistently outperforms baselines across 7 distribution shift, 6 transfer learning, and 3 few-shot learning benchmarks. On WILDS-iWILDCam, our proposed approach FLYP outperforms the top of the leaderboard by 2.3% ID and 2.7% OOD, giving the highest reported accuracy. Averaged across 7 OOD datasets (2 WILDS and 5 ImageNet associated shifts), FLYP gives gains of 4.2% OOD over standard finetuning and outperforms current state-ofthe-art (LP-FT) by more than 1% both ID and OOD. Similarly, on 3 few-shot learning benchmarks, FLYP gives gains up to 4.6% over standard finetuning and 4.4% over the state-of-the-art. Thus we establish our proposed method of contrastive finetuning as a simple and intuitive state-ofthe-art for supervised finetuning of image-text models like CLIP.

Teaching Structured Vision & Language Concepts to Vision & Language Models,"Vision and Language (VL) models have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot performance in a variety of tasks. However, some aspects of complex language understanding still remain a challenge. We introduce the collective notion of Structured Vision & Language Concepts (SVLC) which includes object attributes, relations, and states which are present in the text and visible in the image. Recent studies have shown that even the best VL models struggle with SVLC. A possible way of fixing this issue is by collecting dedicated datasets for teaching each SVLC type, yet this might be expensive and time-consuming. Instead, we propose a more elegant data-driven approach for enhancing VL models' understanding of SVLCs that makes more effective use of existing VL pre-training datasets and does not require any additional data. While automatic understanding of image structure still remains largely unsolved, language structure is much better modeled and understood, allowing for its effective utilization in teaching VL models. In this paper, we propose various techniques based on language structure understanding that can be used to manipulate the textual part of off-the-shelf paired VL datasets. VL models trained with the updated data exhibit a significant improvement of up to 15% in their SVLC understanding with only a mild degradation in their zero-shot capabilities both when training from scratch or fine-tuning a pre-trained model. Our code and pretrained models are available at: https://github.com/SivanDoveh/TSVLC",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Doveh_Teaching_Structured_Vision__Language_Concepts_to_Vision__Language_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Bi-Directional Distribution Alignment for Transductive Zero-Shot Learning,"It is well-known that zero-shot learning (ZSL) can suffer severely from the problem of domain shift, where the true and learned data distributions for the unseen classes do not match. Although transductive ZSL (TZSL) attempts to improve this by allowing the use of unlabelled examples from the unseen classes, there is still a high level of distribution shift. We propose a novel TZSL model (named as Bi-VAEGAN), which largely improves the shift by a strengthened distribution alignment between the visual and auxiliary spaces. The key proposal of the model design includes (1) a bi-directional distribution alignment, (2) a simple but effective L_2-norm based feature normalization approach, and (3) a more sophisticated unseen class prior estimation approach. In benchmark evaluation using four datasets, Bi-VAEGAN achieves the new state of the arts under both the standard and generalized TZSL settings. Code could be found at https://github.com/Zhicaiwww/Bi-VAEGAN.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wang_Bi-Directional_Distribution_Alignment_for_Transductive_Zero-Shot_Learning_CVPR_2023_paper.html
I2MVFormer: Large Language Model Generated Multi-View Document Supervision for Zero-Shot Image Classification,"Recent works have shown that unstructured text (documents) from online sources can serve as useful auxiliary information for zero-shot image classification. However, these methods require access to a high-quality source like Wikipedia and are limited to a single source of information. Large Language Models (LLM) trained on web-scale text show impressive abilities to repurpose their learned knowledge for a multitude of tasks. In this work, we provide a novel perspective on using an LLM to provide text supervision for a zero-shot image classification model. The LLM is provided with a few text descriptions from different annotators as examples. The LLM is conditioned on these examples to generate multiple text descriptions for each class (referred to as views). Our proposed model, I2MVFormer, learns multi-view semantic embeddings for zero-shot image classification with these class views. We show that each text view of a class provides complementary information allowing a model to learn a highly discriminative class embedding. Moreover, we show that I2MVFormer is better at consuming the multi-view text supervision from LLM compared to baseline models. I2MVFormer establishes a new state-of-the-art on three public benchmark datasets for zero-shot image classification with unsupervised semantic embeddings.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Naeem_I2MVFormer_Large_Language_Model_Generated_Multi-View_Document_Supervision_for_Zero-Shot_CVPR_2023_paper.html
LASP: Text-to-Text Optimization for Language-Aware Soft Prompting of Vision & Language Models,"Soft prompt learning has recently emerged as one of the methods of choice for adapting V&L models to a downstream task using a few training examples. However, current methods significantly overfit the training data, suffering from large accuracy degradation when tested on unseen classes from the same domain. To this end, in this paper, we make the following 4 contributions: (1) To alleviate base class overfitting, we propose a novel Language-Aware Soft Prompting (LASP) learning method by means of a text-to-text cross-entropy loss that maximizes the probability of the learned prompts to be correctly classified with respect to pre-defined hand-crafted textual prompts. (2) To increase the representation capacity of the prompts, we propose grouped LASP where each group of prompts is optimized with respect to a separate subset of textual prompts. (3) We identify a visual-language misalignment introduced by prompt learning and LASP, and more importantly, propose a re-calibration mechanism to address it. (4) We show that LASP is inherently amenable to including, during training, virtual classes, i.e. class names for which no visual samples are available, further increasing the robustness of the learned prompts. Through evaluations on 11 datasets, we show that our approach (a) significantly outperforms all prior works on soft prompting, and (b) matches and surpasses, for the first time, the accuracy on novel classes obtained by hand-crafted prompts and CLIP for 8 out of 11 test datasets. Code will be made available.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Bulat_LASP_Text-to-Text_Optimization_for_Language-Aware_Soft_Prompting_of_Vision__CVPR_2023_paper.html
Zero-Shot Referring Image Segmentation With Global-Local Context Features,"Referring image segmentation (RIS) aims to find a segmentation mask given a referring expression grounded to a region of the input image. Collecting labelled datasets for this task, however, is notoriously costly and labor-intensive. To overcome this issue, we propose a simple yet effective zero-shot referring image segmentation method by leveraging the pre-trained cross-modal knowledge from CLIP. In order to obtain segmentation masks grounded to the input text, we propose a mask-guided visual encoder that captures global and local contextual information of an input image. By utilizing instance masks obtained from off-the-shelf mask proposal techniques, our method is able to segment fine-detailed instance-level groundings. We also introduce a global-local text encoder where the global feature captures complex sentence-level semantics of the entire input expression while the local feature focuses on the target noun phrase extracted by a dependency parser. In our experiments, the proposed method outperforms several zero-shot baselines of the task and even the weakly supervised referring expression segmentation method with substantial margins. Our code is available at https://github.com/Seonghoon-Yu/Zero-shot-RIS.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Yu_Zero-Shot_Referring_Image_Segmentation_With_Global-Local_Context_Features_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Few-Shot Learning With Visual Distribution Calibration and Cross-Modal Distribution Alignment,"Pre-trained vision-language models have inspired much research on few-shot learning. However, with only a few training images, there exist two crucial problems: (1) the visual feature distributions are easily distracted by class-irrelevant information in images, and (2) the alignment between the visual and language feature distributions is difficult. To deal with the distraction problem, we propose a Selective Attack module, which consists of trainable adapters that generate spatial attention maps of images to guide the attacks on class-irrelevant image areas. By messing up these areas, the critical features are captured and the visual distributions of image features are calibrated. To better align the visual and language feature distributions that describe the same object class, we propose a cross-modal distribution alignment module, in which we introduce a vision-language prototype for each class to align the distributions, and adopt the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) to optimize the prototypes. For efficient computation, the upper bound of EMD is derived. In addition, we propose an augmentation strategy to increase the diversity of the images and the text prompts, which can reduce overfitting to the few-shot training images. Extensive experiments on 11 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms prior arts in few-shot learning.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/CVPR2023/html/Wang_Few-Shot_Learning_With_Visual_Distribution_Calibration_and_Cross-Modal_Distribution_Alignment_CVPR_2023_paper.html
Distilling Large Vision-Language Model with Out-of-Distribution Generalizability,"Large vision-language models have achieved outstanding performance, but their size and computational requirements make their deployment on resource-constrained devices and time-sensitive tasks impractical. Model distillation, the process of creating smaller, faster models that maintain the performance of larger models, is a promising direction towards the solution. This paper investigates the distillation of visual representations in large teacher vision-language models into lightweight student models using a small- or mid-scale dataset. Notably, this study focuses on open-vocabulary out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization, a challenging problem that has been overlooked in previous model distillation literature. We propose two principles from vision and language modality perspectives to enhance student's OOD generalization: (1) by better imitating teacher's visual representation space, and carefully promoting better coherence in vision-language alignment with the teacher; (2) by enriching the teacher's language representations with informative and finegrained semantic attributes to effectively distinguish between different labels. We propose several metrics and conduct extensive experiments to investigate their techniques. The results demonstrate significant improvements in zero-shot and few-shot student performance on open-vocabulary out-of-distribution classification, highlighting the effectiveness of our proposed approaches.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Li_Distilling_Large_Vision-Language_Model_with_Out-of-Distribution_Generalizability_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Improving Diversity in Zero-Shot GAN Adaptation with Semantic Variations,"Training deep generative models usually requires a large amount of data. To alleviate the data collection cost, the task of zero-shot GAN adaptation aims to reuse well-trained generators to synthesize images of an unseen target domain without any further training samples. Due to the data absence, the textual description of the target domain and the vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, are utilized to effectively guide the generator. However, with only a single representative text feature instead of real images, the synthesized images gradually lose diversity as the model is optimized, which is also known as mode collapse. To tackle the problem, we propose a novel method to find semantic variations of the target text in the CLIP space. Specifically, we explore diverse semantic variations based on the informative text feature of the target domain while regularizing the uncontrolled deviation of the semantic information. With the obtained variations, we design a novel directional moment loss that matches the first and second moments of image and text direction distributions. Moreover, we introduce elastic weight consolidation and a relation consistency loss to effectively preserve valuable content information from the source domain, e.g., appearances. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods in ensuring sample diversity in various scenarios of zero-shot GAN adaptation. We also conduct ablation studies to validate the effect of each proposed component. Notably, our model achieves a new state-of-the-art on zero-shot GAN adaptation in terms of both diversity and quality.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Jeon_Improving_Diversity_in_Zero-Shot_GAN_Adaptation_with_Semantic_Variations_ICCV_2023_paper.html
SINC: Self-Supervised In-Context Learning for Vision-Language Tasks,"Large Pre-trained Transformers exhibit an intriguing capacity for in-context learning. Without gradient updates, these models can rapidly construct new predictors from demonstrations presented in the inputs. Recent works promote this ability in the vision-language domain by incorporating visual information into large language models that can already make in-context predictions. However, these methods could inherit issues in the language domain, such as template sensitivity and hallucination. Also, the scale of these language models raises a significant demand for computations, making learning and operating these models resource-intensive. To this end, we raise a question: ""How can we enable in-context learning without relying on the intrinsic in-context ability of large language models?"". To answer it, we propose a succinct and general framework, Self-supervised IN-Context learning (SINC), that introduces a meta-model to learn on self-supervised prompts consisting of tailored demonstrations. The learned models can be transferred to downstream tasks for making in-context predictions on-the-fly. Extensive experiments show that SINC outperforms gradient-based methods in various vision-language tasks under few-shot settings. Furthermore, the designs of SINC help us investigate the benefits of in-context learning across different tasks, and the analysis further reveals the essential components for the emergence of in-context learning in the vision-language domain.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Chen_SINC_Self-Supervised_In-Context_Learning_for_Vision-Language_Tasks_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Going Beyond Nouns With Vision & Language Models Using Synthetic Data,"Large-scale pre-trained Vision & Language (VL) models have shown remarkable performance in many applications, enabling replacing a fixed set of supported classes with zero-shot open vocabulary reasoning over (almost arbitrary) natural language prompts. However, recent works have uncovered a fundamental weakness of these models. For example, their difficulty to understand Visual Language Concepts (VLC) that go 'beyond nouns' such as the meaning of non-object words (e.g., attributes, actions, relations, states, etc.), or difficulty in performing compositional reasoning such as understanding the significance of the order of the words in a sentence. In this work, we investigate to which extent purely synthetic data could be leveraged to teach these models to overcome such shortcomings without compromising their zero-shot capabilities. We contribute Synthetic Visual Concepts (SyViC) - a million-scale synthetic dataset and data generation codebase allowing to generate additional suitable data to improve VLC understanding and compositional reasoning of VL models. Additionally, we propose a general VL finetuning strategy for effectively leveraging SyViC towards achieving these improvements. Our extensive experiments and ablations on VL-Checklist, Winoground, and ARO benchmarks demonstrate that it is possible to adapt strong pre-trained VL models with synthetic data significantly enhancing their VLC understanding (e.g. by 9.9% on ARO and 4.3% on VL-Checklist) with under 1% drop in their zero-shot accuracy.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Cascante-Bonilla_Going_Beyond_Nouns_With_Vision__Language_Models_Using_Synthetic_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Continual Zero-Shot Learning through Semantically Guided Generative Random Walks,"Learning novel concepts, remembering previous knowledge, and adapting it to future tasks occur simultaneously throughout a human's lifetime. To model such comprehensive abilities, continual zero-shot learning (CZSL) has recently been introduced. However, most existing methods overused the unseen semantic information that may not be continually accessible in realistic settings. In this paper, we address the challenge of continual zero-shot learning where unseen information is not provided during training, by leveraging generative modeling. The heart of the generative-based methods is to learn quality representations from seen classes to improve the generative understanding of the unseen visual space. Motivated by this, we introduce generalization-bound tools and provide the first theoretical explanation for the benefits of generative modeling to CZSL tasks. Guided by the theoretical analysis, we then propose our learning algorithm that employs a novel semantically guided Generative Random Walk (GRW) loss. The GRW loss augments the training by continually encouraging the model to generate realistic and characterized samples to represent the unseen space. Our algorithm achieves state-of-the-art performance on AWA1, AWA2, CUB, and SUN datasets, surpassing existing CZSL methods by 3-7%.

Zero-Shot Contrastive Loss for Text-Guided Diffusion Image Style Transfer,"Diffusion models have shown great promise in text-guided image style transfer, but there is a trade-off between style transformation and content preservation due to their stochastic nature. Existing methods require computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models or additional neural network. To address this, here we propose a zero-shot contrastive loss for diffusion models that doesn't require additional fine-tuning or auxiliary networks. By leveraging patch-wise contrastive loss between generated samples and original image embeddings in the pre-trained diffusion model, our method can generate images with the same semantic content as the source image in a zero-shot manner. Our approach outperforms existing methods while preserving content and requiring no additional training, not only for image style transfer but also for image-to-image translation and manipulation. Our experimental results validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Yang_Zero-Shot_Contrastive_Loss_for_Text-Guided_Diffusion_Image_Style_Transfer_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Exploring Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation from CLIP Vision Encoder Distillation Only,"Semantic segmentation is a crucial task in computer vision that involves segmenting images into semantically meaningful regions at the pixel level. However, existing approaches often rely on expensive human annotations as supervision for model training, limiting their scalability to large, unlabeled datasets. To address this challenge, we present ZeroSeg, a novel method that leverages the existing pretrained vision-language (VL) model (e.g. CLIP vision encoder) to train open-vocabulary zero-shot semantic segmentation models. Although acquired extensive knowledge of visual concepts, it is non-trivial to exploit knowledge from these VL models to the task of semantic segmentation, as they are usually trained at an image level. ZeroSeg overcomes this by distilling the visual concepts learned by VL models into a set of segment tokens, each summarizing a localized region of the target image. We evaluate ZeroSeg on multiple popular segmentation benchmarks, including PASCAL VOC 2012, PASCAL Context, and COCO, in a zero-shot manner Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance when compared to other zero-shot segmentation methods under the same training data, while also performing competitively compared to strongly supervised methods. Finally, we also demonstrated the effectiveness of ZeroSeg on open-vocabulary segmentation, through both human studies and qualitative visualizations. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/facebookresearch/ZeroSeg",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Chen_Exploring_Open-Vocabulary_Semantic_Segmentation_from_CLIP_Vision_Encoder_Distillation_Only_ICCV_2023_paper.html
DiffuMask: Synthesizing Images with Pixel-level Annotations for Semantic Segmentation Using Diffusion Models,"Collecting and annotating images with pixel-wise labels is time-consuming and laborious. In contrast, synthetic data can be freely available using a generative model (e.g., DALL-E, Stable Diffusion). In this paper, we show that it is possible to automatically obtain accurate semantic masks of synthetic images generated by the pre-trained Stable Diffusion, which uses only text-image pairs during training. Our approach, called DiffuMask, exploits the potential of the cross-attention map between text and image, which is natural and seamless to extend the text-driven
 image synthesis to semantic mask generation. DiffuMask uses text-guided cross-attention information to localize class/word-specific regions, which are combined with practical techniques to create a novel high-resolution and class-discriminative pixel-wise mask. The methods help to reduce data collection and annotation costs obviously. Experiments demonstrate that the existing segmentation methods trained on synthetic data of DiffuMask can achieve a
 competitive performance over the counterpart of real data (VOC 2012, Cityscapes). For some classes (e.g., bird), DiffuMask presents promising performance, close to the state-of-the-art result of real data (within 3% mIoU gap). Moreover, in the open-vocabulary segmentation (zero-shot) setting,
 DiffuMask achieves a new SOTA result on Unseen class of VOC 2012.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wu_DiffuMask_Synthesizing_Images_with_Pixel-level_Annotations_for_Semantic_Segmentation_Using_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Zero-Shot Spatial Layout Conditioning for Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,"Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have significantly improved the state of the art in generative image modeling and allow for an intuitive and powerful user interface to drive the image generation process. Expressing spatial constraints, e.g. to position specific objects in particular locations, is cumbersome using text; and current text-based image generation models are not able to accurately follow such instructions. In this paper we consider image generation from text associated with segments on the image canvas, which combines an intuitive natural language interface with precise spatial control over the generated content. We propose ZestGuide, a ""ZEro-shot"" SegmenTation Guidance approach that can be plugged into pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models, and does not require any additional training. It leverages implicit segmentation maps that can be extracted from cross-attention layers, and uses them to align the generation with input masks. Our experimental results combine high image quality with accurate alignment of generated content with input segmentations, and improve over prior work both quantitatively and qualitatively, including methods that require training on images with corresponding segmentations. Compared to Paint with Words, the previous state-of-the art in image generation with zero-shot segmentation conditioning, we improve by 5 to 10 mIoU points on the COCO dataset with similar FID scores.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Couairon_Zero-Shot_Spatial_Layout_Conditioning_for_Text-to-Image_Diffusion_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Distilled Reverse Attention Network for Open-world Compositional Zero-Shot Learning,"Open-World Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (OW-CZSL) aims to recognize new compositions of seen attributes and objects. In OW-CZSL, methods built on the conventional closed-world setting degrade severely due to the unconstrained OW test space. While previous works alleviate the issue by pruning compositions according to external knowledge or correlations in seen pairs, they introduce biases that harm the generalization. Some methods thus predict state and object with independently constructed and trained classifiers, ignoring that attributes are highly context-dependent and visually entangled with objects. In this paper, we propose a novel Distilled Reverse Attention Network to address the challenges. We also model attributes and objects separately but with different motivations, capturing contextuality and locality, respectively. We further design a reverse-and-distill strategy that learns disentangled representations of elementary components in training data supervised by reverse attention and knowledge distillation. We conduct experiments on three datasets and consistently achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Li_Distilled_Reverse_Attention_Network_for_Open-world_Compositional_Zero-Shot_Learning_ICCV_2023_paper.html
I Can't Believe There's No Images! Learning Visual Tasks Using only Language Supervision,"Many high-level skills that are required for computer vision tasks, such as parsing questions, comparing and contrasting semantics, and writing descriptions, are also required in other domains such as natural language processing. In this paper, we ask whether it is possible to learn those skills from text data and then transfer them to vision tasks without ever training on visual training data. Key to our approach is exploiting the joint embedding space of contrastively trained vision and language encoders. In practice, there can be systematic differences between embedding spaces for different modalities in contrastive models, and we analyze how these differences affect our approach and study strategies to mitigate this concern. We produce models using only text training data on four representative tasks: image captioning, visual entailment, visual question answering and visual news captioning, and evaluate them on standard benchmarks using images. We find these models perform close to models trained on images, while surpassing prior work for captioning and visual entailment in this text-only setting by over 9 points, and outperforming all prior work on visual news by over 30 points. We also showcase a variety of stylistic image captioning models that are trained using no image data and no human-curated language data, but instead using readily-available text data from books, the web, or language models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Gu_I_Cant_Believe_Theres_No_Images_Learning_Visual_Tasks_Using_ICCV_2023_paper.html
LoGoPrompt: Synthetic Text Images Can Be Good Visual Prompts for Vision-Language Models,"Prompt engineering is a powerful tool used to enhance the performance of pre-trained models on downstream tasks. For example, providing the prompt ""Let's think step by step"" improved GPT-3's reasoning accuracy to 63% on MutiArith while prompting ""a photo of"" filled with a class name enables CLIP to achieve 80% zero-shot accuracy on ImageNet. While previous research has explored prompt learning for the visual modality, analyzing what constitutes a good visual prompt specifically for image recognition is limited. In addition, existing visual prompt tuning methods' generalization ability is worse than text-only prompting tuning. This paper explores our key insight: synthetic text images are good visual prompts for vision-language models! To achieve that, we propose our LoGoPrompt, which reformulates the classification objective to the visual prompt selection and addresses the chicken-and-egg challenge of first adding synthetic text images as class-wise visual prompts or predicting the class first. Without any trainable visual prompt parameters, experimental results on 16 datasets demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in few-shot learning, base-to-new generalization, and domain generalization. The code will be publicly available upon publication.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Shi_LoGoPrompt_Synthetic_Text_Images_Can_Be_Good_Visual_Prompts_for_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Waffling Around for Performance: Visual Classification with Random Words and Broad Concepts,"The visual classification performance of vision-language models such as CLIP has been shown to benefit from additional semantic knowledge from large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-3. In particular, averaging over LLM-generated class descriptors, e.g. ""waffle, which has a round shape"", can notably improve generalization performance. In this work, we critically study this behavior and propose WaffleCLIP, a framework for zero-shot visual classification which simply replaces LLM-generated descriptors with random character and word descriptors. Without querying external models, we achieve comparable performance gains on a large number of visual classification tasks. This allows WaffleCLIP to both serve as a low-cost 
 alternative, as well as a sanity check for any future LLM-based vision-language model extensions. We conduct an extensive experimental study on the impact and shortcomings of additional semantics introduced with LLM-generated descriptors, and showcase how - if available - semantic context is better leveraged by querying LLMs for high-level concepts, which we show can be done to jointly resolve potential class name ambiguities.

"MAtch, eXpand and Improve: Unsupervised Finetuning for Zero-Shot Action Recognition with Language Knowledge","Large scale Vision-Language (VL) models have shown tremendous success in aligning representations between visual and text modalities. This enables remarkable progress in zero-shot recognition, image generation & editing, and many other exciting tasks. However, VL models tend to over-represent objects while paying much less attention to verbs, and require additional tuning on video data for best zero-shot action recognition performance. While previous work relied on large-scale, fully-annotated data, in this work we propose an unsupervised approach. We adapt a VL model for zero-shot and few-shot action recognition using a collection of unlabeled videos and an unpaired action dictionary. Based on that, we leverage Large Language Models and VL models to build a text bag for each unlabeled video via matching, text expansion and captioning. We use those bags in a Multiple Instance Learning setup to adapt an image-text backbone to video data. Although finetuned on unlabeled video data, our resulting models demonstrate high transferability to numerous unseen zero-shot downstream tasks, improving the base VL model performance by up to 14%, and even comparing favorably to fully-supervised baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot video recognition transfer. The code is provided in supplementary and will be released upon acceptance.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Lin_MAtch_eXpand_and_Improve_Unsupervised_Finetuning_for_Zero-Shot_Action_Recognition_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Meta-ZSDETR: Zero-shot DETR with Meta-learning,"Zero-shot object detection aims to localize and recognize objects of unseen classes. Most of existing works face two problems: the low recall of RPN in unseen classes and the confusion of unseen classes with background. In this paper, we present the first method that combines DETR and meta-learning to perform zero-shot object detection, named Meta-ZSDETR, where model training is formalized as an individual episode based meta-learning task. Different from Faster R-CNN based methods that firstly generate class-agnostic proposals, and then classify them with visual-semantic alignment module, Meta-ZSDETR directly predict class-specific boxes with class-specific queries and further filter them with the predicted accuracy from classification head. The model is optimized with meta-contrastive learning, which contains a regression head to generate the coordinates of class-specific boxes, a classification head to predict the accuracy of generated boxes, and a contrastive head that utilizes the proposed contrastive-reconstruction loss to further separate different classes in visual space. We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets MS COCO and PASCAL VOC. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the existing ZSD methods by a large margin.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhang_Meta-ZSDETR_Zero-shot_DETR_with_Meta-learning_ICCV_2023_paper.html
See More and Know More: Zero-shot Point Cloud Segmentation via Multi-modal Visual Data,"Zero-shot point cloud segmentation aims to make deep models capable of recognizing novel objects in point cloud that are unseen in the training phase. Recent trends favor the pipeline which transfers knowledge from seen classes with labels to unseen classes without labels. They typically align visual features with semantic features obtained from word embedding by the supervision of seen classes' annotations. However, point cloud contains limited information to fully match with semantic features. In fact, the rich appearance information of images is a natural complement to the textureless point cloud, which is not well explored in previous literature. Motivated by this, we propose a novel multi-modal zero-shot learning method to better utilize the complementary information of point clouds and images for more accurate visual-semantic alignment. Extensive experiments are performed in two popular benchmarks, i.e, SemanticKITTI and nuScenes, and our method outperforms current SOTA methods with 52% and 49% improvement on average for unseen class mIoU, respectively.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Lu_See_More_and_Know_More_Zero-shot_Point_Cloud_Segmentation_via_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Verbs in Action: Improving Verb Understanding in Video-Language Models,"Understanding verbs is crucial to modelling how people and objects interact with each other and the environment through space and time. Recently, state-of-the-art video-language models based on CLIP have been shown to have limited verb understanding and to rely extensively on nouns, restricting their performance in real-world video applications that require action and temporal understanding. In this work, we improve verb understanding for CLIP-based video-language models by proposing a new Verb-Focused Contrastive (VFC) framework. This consists of two main components: (1) leveraging pretrained large language models (LLMs) to create hard negatives for cross-modal contrastive learning, together with a calibration strategy to balance the occurrence of concepts in positive and negative pairs; and (2) enforcing a fine-grained, verb phrase alignment loss. Our method achieves state-of-the-art results for zero-shot performance on three downstream tasks that focus on verb understanding, including video-text matching, video question-answering and video classification; while maintaining performance on noun-focused settings. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work which proposes a method to alleviate the verb understanding problem, and does not simply highlight it.

Zero-Shot Point Cloud Segmentation by Semantic-Visual Aware Synthesis,"This paper proposes a feature synthesis approach for zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds, enabling generalization to previously unseen categories. Given only the class-level semantic information for unseen objects, we strive to enhance the correspondence, alignment and consistency between the visual and semantic spaces, to synthesise diverse, generic and transferable visual features. We develop a masked learning strategy to promote diversity within the same class visual features and enhance the separation between different classes. We further cast the visual features into a prototypical space to model their distribution for alignment with the corresponding semantic space. Finally, we develop a consistency regularizer to preserve the semantic-visual relationships between the real-seen features and synthetic-unseen features. Our approach shows considerable semantic segmentation gains on ScanNet, S3DIS and SemanticKITTI benchmarks.

Diverse Data Augmentation with Diffusions for Effective Test-time Prompt Tuning,"Benefiting from prompt tuning, recent years have witnessed the promising performance of pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, on versatile downstream tasks. In this paper, we focus on a particular setting of learning adaptive prompts on the fly for each test sample from an unseen new domain, which is known as test-time prompt tuning (TPT). Existing TPT methods typically rely on data augmentation and confidence selection. However, conventional data augmentation techniques, e.g., random resized crops, suffers from the lack of data diversity, while entropy-based confidence selection alone is not sufficient to guarantee prediction fidelity. To address these issues, we propose a novel TPT method, named DiffTPT, which leverages pre-trained diffusion models to generate diverse and informative new data. Specifically, we incorporate augmented data by both conventional method and pre-trained stable diffusion to exploit their respective merits, improving the model's ability to adapt to unknown new test data. Moreover, to ensure the prediction fidelity of generated data, we introduce a cosine similarity-based filtration technique to select the generated data with higher similarity to the single test sample. Our experiments on test datasets with distribution shifts and unseen categories demonstrate that DiffTPT improves the zero-shot accuracy by an average of 5.13% compared to the state-of-the-art TPT method.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Feng_Diverse_Data_Augmentation_with_Diffusions_for_Effective_Test-time_Prompt_Tuning_ICCV_2023_paper.html
GePSAn: Generative Procedure Step Anticipation in Cooking Videos,"We study the problem of future step anticipation in procedural videos. Given a video of an ongoing procedural activity, we predict a plausible next procedure step described in rich natural language. While most previous work focus on the problem of data scarcity in procedural video datasets, another core challenge of future anticipation is how to account for multiple plausible future realizations in natural settings. This problem has been largely overlooked in previous work. To address this challenge, we frame future step prediction as modelling the distribution of all possible candidates for the next step. Specifically, we design a generative model that takes a series of video clips as input, and generates multiple plausible and diverse candidates (in natural language) for the next step. Following previous work, we side-step the video annotation scarcity by pretraining our model on a large text-based corpus of procedural activities, and then transfer the model to the video domain. Our experiments, both in textual and video domains, show that our model captures diversity in the next step prediction and generates multiple plausible future predictions. Moreover, our model establishes new state-of-the-art results on YouCookII, where it outperforms existing baselines on the next step anticipation. Finally, we also show that our model can successfully transfer from text to the video domain zero-shot, ie, without fine-tuning or adaptation, and produces good-quality future step predictions from video.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Abdelsalam_GePSAn_Generative_Procedure_Step_Anticipation_in_Cooking_Videos_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Regularized Mask Tuning: Uncovering Hidden Knowledge in Pre-Trained Vision-Language Models,"Prompt tuning and adapter tuning have shown great potential in transferring pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to various downstream tasks. In this work, we design a new type of tuning method, termed as regularized mask tuning, which masks the network parameters through a learnable selection. Inspired by neural pathways, we argue that the knowledge required by a downstream task already exists in the pre-trained weights but just gets concealed in the upstream pre-training stage. To bring the useful knowledge back into light, we first identify a set of parameters that are important to a given downstream task, then attach a binary mask to each parameter, and finally optimize these masks on the downstream data with the parameters frozen. When updating the mask, we introduce a novel gradient dropout strategy to regularize the parameter selection, in order to prevent the model from forgetting old knowledge and overfitting the downstream data. Experimental results on 11 datasets demonstrate the consistent superiority of our method over previous alternatives. It is noteworthy that we manage to deliver 18.73% performance improvement compared to the zero-shot CLIP via masking an average of only 2.56% parameters. Furthermore, our method is synergistic with most existing parameter-efficient tuning methods and can boost the performance on top of them. Code will be made publicly available.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zheng_Regularized_Mask_Tuning_Uncovering_Hidden_Knowledge_in_Pre-Trained_Vision-Language_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Black Box Few-Shot Adaptation for Vision-Language Models,"Vision-Language (V-L) models trained with contrastive learning to align the visual and language modalities have been shown to be strong few-shot learners. Soft prompt learning is the method of choice for few-shot downstream adaption aiming to bridge the modality gap caused by the distribution shift induced by the new domain. While parameter-efficient, prompt learning still requires access to the model weights and can be computationally infeasible for large models with billions of parameters. To address these shortcomings, in this work, we describe a black-box method for V-L few-shot adaptation that (a) operates on pre-computed image and text features and hence works without access to the model's weights, (b) it is orders of magnitude faster at training time, (c) it is amenable to both supervised and unsupervised training, and (d) it can be even used to align image and text features computed from uni-modal models. To achieve this, we propose Linear Feature Alignment (LFA), a simple linear approach for V-L re-alignment in the target domain. LFA is initialized from a closed-form solution to a least-squares problem and then it is iteratively updated by minimizing a re-ranking loss. Despite its simplicity, our approach can even surpass soft-prompt learning methods as shown by extensive experiments on 11 image and 2 video datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Ouali_Black_Box_Few-Shot_Adaptation_for_Vision-Language_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Hyperbolic Audio-visual Zero-shot Learning,"Audio-visual zero-shot learning aims to classify samples consisting of a pair of corresponding audio and video sequences from classes that are not present during training. An analysis of the audio-visual data reveals a large degree of hyperbolicity, indicating the potential benefit of using a hyperbolic transformation to achieve curvature-aware geometric learning, with the aim of exploring more complex hierarchical data structures for this task. The proposed approach employs a novel loss function that incorporates cross-modality alignment between video and audio features in the hyperbolic space. Additionally, we explore the use of multiple adaptive curvatures for hyperbolic projections. The experimental results on this very challenging task demonstrate that our proposed hyperbolic approach for zero-shot learning outperforms the SOTA method on three datasets: VGGSound-GZSL, UCF-GZSL, and ActivityNet-GZSL achieving a harmonic mean (HM) improvement of around 3.0%, 7.0%, and 5.3%, respectively.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Hong_Hyperbolic_Audio-visual_Zero-shot_Learning_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Zero-guidance Segmentation Using Zero Segment Labels,"The joint visual-language model CLIP has enabled new and exciting applications, such as open-vocabulary segmentation, which can locate any segment given an arbitrary text query. In our research, we ask whether it is possible to discover semantic segments without any user guidance in the form of text queries or predefined classes, and label them using natural language automatically? We propose a novel problem zero-guidance segmentation and the first baseline that leverages two pre-trained generalist models, DINO and CLIP, to solve this problem without any fine-tuning or segmentation dataset. The general idea is to first segment an image into small over-segments, encode them into CLIP's visual-language space, translate them into text labels, and merge semantically similar segments together. The key challenge, however, is how to encode a visual segment into a segment-specific embedding that balances global and local context information, both useful for recognition. Our main contribution is a novel attention-masking technique that balances the two contexts by analyzing the attention layers inside CLIP. We also introduce several metrics for the evaluation of this new task. With CLIP's innate knowledge, our method can precisely locate the Mona Lisa painting among a museum crowd.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Rewatbowornwong_Zero-guidance_Segmentation_Using_Zero_Segment_Labels_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Zero-Shot Composed Image Retrieval with Textual Inversion,"Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) aims to retrieve a target image based on a query composed of a reference image and a relative caption that describes the difference between the two images. The high effort and cost required for labeling datasets for CIR hamper the widespread usage of existing methods, as they rely on supervised learning. In this work, we propose a new task, Zero-Shot CIR (ZS-CIR), that aims to address CIR without requiring a labeled training dataset. Our approach, named zero-Shot composEd imAge Retrieval with textuaL invErsion SEARLE, maps the visual features of the reference image into a pseudo-word token in CLIP token embedding space and integrates it with the relative caption. To support research on ZS-CIR, we introduce an open-domain benchmarking dataset named Composed Image Retrieval on Common Objects in context (CIRCO), which is the first dataset for CIR containing multiple ground-truths for each query. The experiments show that SEARLE exhibits better performance than the baselines on the two main datasets for CIR tasks, FashionIQ and CIRR, and on the proposed CIRCO.

What Does a Platypus Look Like? Generating Customized Prompts for Zero-Shot Image Classification,"Open-vocabulary models are a promising new paradigm for image classification. Unlike traditional classification models, open-vocabulary models classify among any arbitrary set of categories specified with natural language during inference. This natural language, called ""prompts"", typically consists of a set of hand-written templates (e.g., ""a photo of a   "") which are completed with each of the category names. This work introduces a simple method to generate higher accuracy prompts, without relying on any explicit knowledge of the task domain and with far fewer hand-constructed sentences. To achieve this, we combine open-vocabulary models with large language models (LLMs) to create Customized Prompts via Language models (CuPL, pronounced ""couple""). In particular, we leverage the knowledge contained in LLMs in order to generate many descriptive sentences that contain important discriminating characteristics of the image categories. This allows the model to place a greater importance on these regions in the image when making predictions. We find that this straightforward and general approach improves accuracy on a range of zero-shot image classification benchmarks, including over one percentage point gain on ImageNet. Finally, this simple baseline requires no additional training and remains completely zero-shot.

Efficiently Robustify Pre-Trained Models,"A recent trend in deep learning algorithms has been towards training large scale models, having high parameter count and trained on big dataset. However, robustness of such large scale models towards real-world settings is still a less-explored topic. In this work, we first benchmark the performance of these models under different perturbations and datasets thereby representing real-world shifts, and highlight their degrading performance under these shifts. We then discuss on how complete model fine-tuning based existing robustification schemes might not be a scalable option given very large scale networks and can also lead them to forget some of the desired characterstics. Finally, we propose a simple and cost-effective method to solve this problem, inspired by knowledge transfer literature. It involves robustifying smaller models, at a lower computation cost, and then use them as teachers to tune a fraction of these large scale networks, reducing the overall computational overhead. We evaluate our proposed method under various vision perturbations including ImageNet-C,R,S,A datasets and also for transfer learning, zero-shot evaluation setups on different datasets. Benchmark results show that our method is able to induce robustness to these large scale models efficiently, requiring significantly lower time and also preserves the transfer learning, zero-shot properties of the original model which none of the existing methods are able to achieve.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Jain_Efficiently_Robustify_Pre-Trained_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Tune-A-Video: One-Shot Tuning of Image Diffusion Models for Text-to-Video Generation,"To replicate the success of text-to-image (T2I) generation, recent works employ large-scale video datasets to train a text-to-video (T2V) generator. Despite their promising results, such paradigm is computationally expensive. In this work, we propose a new T2V generation setting--One-Shot Video Tuning, where only one text-video pair is presented. Our model is built on state-of-the-art T2I diffusion models pre-trained on massive image data. We make two key observations: 1) T2I models can generate still images that represent verb terms; 2) extending T2I models to generate multiple images concurrently exhibits surprisingly good content consistency. To further learn continuous motion, we introduce Tune-A-Video, which involves a tailored spatio-temporal attention mechanism and an efficient one-shot tuning strategy. At inference, we employ DDIM inversion to provide structure guidance for sampling. Extensive qualitative and numerical experiments demonstrate the remarkable ability of our method across various applications.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wu_Tune-A-Video_One-Shot_Tuning_of_Image_Diffusion_Models_for_Text-to-Video_Generation_ICCV_2023_paper.html
What does CLIP know about a red circle? Visual prompt engineering for VLMs,"Large-scale Vision-Language Models, such as CLIP, learn powerful image-text representations that have found numerous applications, from zero-shot classification to text-to-image generation. Despite that, their capabilities for solving novel discriminative tasks via prompting fall behind those of large language models, such as GPT-3. Here we explore the idea of visual prompt engineering for solving computer vision tasks beyond classification by editing in image space instead of text. In particular, we discover an emergent ability of CLIP, where, by simply drawing a red circle around an object, we can direct the model's attention to that region, while also maintaining global information. We show the power of this simple approach by achieving state-of-the-art in zero-shot referring expressions comprehension and strong performance in keypoint localization tasks. Finally, we draw attention to some potential ethical concerns of large language-vision models.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Shtedritski_What_does_CLIP_know_about_a_red_circle_Visual_prompt_ICCV_2023_paper.html
A Simple Framework for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation and Detection,"In this work, we present OpenSeeD, a simple Open-vocabulary Segmentation and Detection framework that learns from different segmentation and detection datasets. To bridge the gap of vocabulary and annotation granularity, we first introduce a pretrained text encoder to encode all the visual concepts in two tasks and learn a common semantic space for them. This gives us reasonably good results compared with the counterparts trained on segmentation task only. To further reconcile them, we locate two discrepancies: i) task discrepancy -- segmentation requires extracting masks for both foreground objects and background stuff, while detection merely cares about the former; ii) data discrepancy -- box and mask annotations are with different spatial granularity, and thus not directly interchangeable. We propose a decoupled foreground/background decoding and a conditioned mask decoding to address these issues, respectively. To this end, we develop a simple encoder-decoder model encompassing all three techniques and train it jointly on COCO and Objects365. After pretraining, our model exhibits competitive or stronger zero-shot transferability for both segmentation and detection. Specifically, OpenSeeD beats the state-of-the-art method for open-vocabulary instance and panoptic segmentation across 5 datasets, and outperforms previous work for open-vocabulary detection on LVIS and ODinW under similar settings. When transferred to specific tasks, our model achieves new SoTA on panoptic segmentation on COCO and ADE20K, and instance segmentation on ADE20K and Cityscapes. 
  Finally, we note that OpenSeed is the first to explore the potential of joint training on segmentation and detection, and hope it can be received as a strong baseline for developing a single model for open-vocabulary segmentation and detection.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhang_A_Simple_Framework_for_Open-Vocabulary_Segmentation_and_Detection_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Hierarchical Visual Primitive Experts for Compositional Zero-Shot Learning,"Compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen compositions with prior knowledge of known primitives (attribute and object). Previous works for CZSL often suffer from grasping the contextuality between attribute and object, as well as the discriminability of visual features, and the long-tailed distribution of real-world compositional data. We propose a simple and scalable framework called Composition Transformer (CoT) to address these issues. CoT employs object and attribute experts in distinctive manners to generate representative embeddings, using the visual network hierarchically. The object expert extracts representative object embeddings from the final layer in a bottom-up manner, while the attribute expert makes attribute embeddings in a top-down manner with a proposed object-guided attention module that models contextuality explicitly. To remedy biased prediction caused by imbalanced data distribution, we develop a simple minority attribute augmentation (MAA) that synthesizes virtual samples by mixing two images and oversampling minority attribute classes. Our method achieves SoTA performance on several benchmarks, including MIT-States, C-GQA, and VAW-CZSL. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of CoT in improving visual discrimination and addressing the model bias from the imbalanced data distribution. The code is available at https://github.com/HanjaeKim98/CoT.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Kim_Hierarchical_Visual_Primitive_Experts_for_Compositional_Zero-Shot_Learning_ICCV_2023_paper.html
One-shot Implicit Animatable Avatars with Model-based Priors,"Existing neural rendering methods for creating human avatars typically either require dense input signals such as video or multi-view images, or leverage a learned prior from large-scale specific 3D human datasets such that reconstruction can be performed with sparse-view inputs. Most of these methods fail to achieve realistic reconstruction when only a single image is available. To enable the data-efficient creation of realistic animatable 3D humans, we propose ELICIT, a novel method for learning human-specific neural radiance fields from a single image. Inspired by the fact that humans can effortlessly estimate the body geometry and imagine full-body clothing from a single image, we leverage two priors in ELICIT: 3D geometry prior and visual semantic prior. Specifically, ELICIT utilizes the 3D body shape geometry prior from a skinned vertex-based template model (i.e., SMPL) and implements the visual clothing semantic prior with the CLIP-based pretrained models. Both priors are used to jointly guide the optimization for creating plausible content in the invisible areas. Taking advantage of the CLIP models, ELICIT can use text descriptions to generate text-conditioned unseen regions. In order to further improve visual details, we propose a segmentation-based sampling strategy that locally refines different parts of the avatar. Comprehensive evaluations on multiple popular benchmarks, including ZJU-MoCAP, Human3.6M, and DeepFashion, show that ELICIT has outperformed strong baseline methods of avatar creation when only a single image is available. The code is public for research purposes at https://huangyangyi.github.io/ELICIT/.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Huang_One-shot_Implicit_Animatable_Avatars_with_Model-based_Priors_ICCV_2023_paper.html
MixReorg: Cross-Modal Mixed Patch Reorganization is a Good Mask Learner for Open-World Semantic Segmentation,"Recently, semantic segmentation models trained with image-level text supervision have shown promising results in challenging open-world scenarios. However, these models still face difficulties in learning fine-grained semantic alignment at the pixel level and predicting accurate object masks. To address this issue, we propose MixReorg, a novel and straightforward pre-training paradigm for semantic segmentation that enhances a model's ability to reorganize patches mixed across images, exploring both local visual relevance and global semantic coherence. Our approach involves generating fine-grained patch-text pairs data by mixing image patches while preserving the correspondence between patches and text. The model is then trained to minimize the segmentation loss of the mixed images and the two contrastive losses of the original and restored features. With MixReorg as a mask learner, conventional text-supervised semantic segmentation models can achieve highly generalizable pixel-semantic alignment ability, which is crucial for open-world segmentation. After training with large-scale image-text data, MixReorg models can be applied directly to segment visual objects of arbitrary categories, without the need for further fine-tuning. Our proposed framework demonstrates strong performance on popular zero-shot semantic segmentation benchmarks, outperforming GroupViT by significant margins of 5.0%, 6.2%, 2.5%, and 3.4% mIoU on PASCAL VOC2012, PASCAL Context, MS COCO, and ADE20K, respectively.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Cai_MixReorg_Cross-Modal_Mixed_Patch_Reorganization_is_a_Good_Mask_Learner_ICCV_2023_paper.html
PointCLIP V2: Prompting CLIP and GPT for Powerful 3D Open-world Learning,"Large-scale pre-trained models have shown promising open-world performance for both vision and language tasks. However, their transferred capacity on 3D point clouds is still limited and only constrained to the classification task. In this paper, we first collaborate CLIP and GPT to be a unified 3D open-world learner, named as PointCLIP V2, which fully unleashes their potential for zero-shot 3D classification, segmentation, and detection. To better align 3D data with the pre-trained language knowledge, PointCLIP V2 contains two key designs. For the visual end, we prompt CLIP via a shape projection module to generate more realistic depth maps, narrowing the domain gap between projected point clouds with natural images. For the textual end, we prompt the GPT model to generate 3D-specific text as the input of CLIP's textual encoder. Without any training in 3D domains, our approach significantly surpasses PointCLIP by +42.90%, +40.44%, and +28.75% accuracy on three datasets for zero-shot 3D classification. On top of that, V2 can be extended to few-shot 3D classification, zero-shot 3D part segmentation, and 3D object detection in a simple manner, demonstrating our generalization ability for unified 3D open-world learning.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhu_PointCLIP_V2_Prompting_CLIP_and_GPT_for_Powerful_3D_Open-world_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Your Diffusion Model is Secretly a Zero-Shot Classifier,"The recent wave of large-scale text-to-image diffusion models has dramatically increased our text-based image generation abilities. These models can generate realistic images for a staggering variety of prompts and exhibit impressive compositional generalization abilities. Almost all use cases thus far have solely focused on sampling; however, diffusion models can also provide conditional density estimates, which are useful for tasks beyond image generation. In this paper, we show that the density estimates from large-scale text-to-image diffusion models like Stable Diffusion can be leveraged to perform zero-shot classification without any additional training. Our generative approach to classification, which we call Diffusion Classifier, attains strong results on a variety of benchmarks and outperforms alternative methods of extracting knowledge from diffusion models. Although a gap remains between generative and discriminative approaches on zero-shot recognition tasks, our diffusion-based approach has stronger multimodal compositional reasoning abilities than competing discriminative approaches. Finally, we use Diffusion Classifier to extract standard classifiers from class-conditional diffusion models trained on ImageNet. These models approach the performance of SOTA discriminative classifiers and exhibit strong ""effective robustness"" to distribution shift. Overall, our results are a step toward using generative over discriminative models for downstream tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Li_Your_Diffusion_Model_is_Secretly_a_Zero-Shot_Classifier_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Image-Free Classifier Injection for Zero-Shot Classification,"Zero-shot learning models achieve remarkable results on image classification for samples from classes that were not seen during training. However, such models must be trained from scratch with specialised methods: therefore, access to a training dataset is required when the need for zero-shot classification arises. In this paper, we aim to equip pre-trained models with zero-shot classification capabilities without the use of image data. We achieve this with our proposed Image-free Classifier Injection with Semantics (ICIS) that injects classifiers for new, unseen classes into pre-trained classification models in a post-hoc fashion without relying on image data. Instead, the existing classifier weights and simple class-wise descriptors, such as class names or attributes, are used. ICIS has two encoder-decoder networks that learn to reconstruct classifier weights from descriptors (and vice versa), exploiting (cross-)reconstruction and cosine losses to regularise the decoding process. Notably, ICIS can be cheaply trained and applied directly on top of pre-trained classification models. Experiments on benchmark ZSL datasets show that ICIS produces unseen classifier weights that achieve strong (generalised) zero-shot classification performance. Code is available at https://github.com/ExplainableML/ImageFreeZSL.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Christensen_Image-Free_Classifier_Injection_for_Zero-Shot_Classification_ICCV_2023_paper.html
CLIPN for Zero-Shot OOD Detection: Teaching CLIP to Say No,"Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection refers to training the model on in-distribution (ID) dataset to classify if the input images come from unknown classes. Considerable efforts have been invested in designing various OOD detection methods based on either convolutional neural networks or transformers. However, Zero-shot OOD detection methods driven by CLIP, which require only class names for ID, have received less attention. This paper presents a novel method, namely CLIP saying no (CLIPN), which empowers ""no"" logic within CLIP. Our key motivation is to equip CLIP with the capability of distinguishing OOD and ID samples via positive-semantic prompts and negation-semantic prompts. To be specific, we design a novel learnable ""no"" prompt and a ""no"" text encoder to capture the negation-semantic with images. Subsequently, we introduce two loss functions: the image-text binary-opposite loss and the text semantic-opposite loss, which we use to teach CLIPN to associate images with ""no"" prompts, thereby enabling it to identify unknown samples. Furthermore, we propose two threshold-free inference algorithms to perform OOD detection via using negation semantics from ""no"" prompts and text encoder. Experimental results on 9 benchmark datasets (3 ID datasets and 6 OOD datasets) for the OOD detection task demonstrate that CLIPN outperforms 7 well-used algorithms by at least 1.1% and 7.37% on AUROC and FPR95 on zero-shot OOD detection of ImageNet-1K. Our CLIPN can serve as a solid foundation for leveraging CLIP effectively in downstream OOD tasks.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wang_CLIPN_for_Zero-Shot_OOD_Detection_Teaching_CLIP_to_Say_No_ICCV_2023_paper.html
EdaDet: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection Using Early Dense Alignment,"Vision-language models such as CLIP have boosted the performance of open-vocabulary object detection, where the detector is trained on base categories but required to detect novel categories. Existing methods leverage CLIP's strong zero-shot recognition ability to align object-level embeddings with textual embeddings of categories. However, we observe that using CLIP for object-level alignment results in overfitting to base categories, i.e., novel categories most similar to base categories have particularly poor performance as they are recognized as similar base categories. In this paper, we first identify that the loss of critical fine-grained local image semantics hinders existing methods from attaining strong base-to-novel generalization. Then, we propose Early Dense Alignment (EDA) to bridge the gap between generalizable local semantics and object-level prediction. In EDA, we use object-level supervision to learn the dense-level rather than object-level alignment to maintain the local fine-grained semantics. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance to competing approaches under the same strict setting and without using external training resources, i.e., improving the +8.4% novel box AP50 on COCO and +3.9% rare mask AP on LVIS.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Shi_EdaDet_Open-Vocabulary_Object_Detection_Using_Early_Dense_Alignment_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Preserve Your Own Correlation: A Noise Prior for Video Diffusion Models,"Despite tremendous progress in generating high-quality images using diffusion models, synthesizing a sequence of animated frames that are both photorealistic and temporally coherent is still in its infancy. While off-the-shelf billion-scale datasets for image generation are available, collecting similar video data of the same scale is still challenging. Also, training a video diffusion model is computationally much more expensive than its image counterpart. In this work, we explore finetuning a pretrained image diffusion model with video data as a practical solution for the video synthesis task. We find that naively extending the image noise prior to video noise prior in video diffusion leads to sub-optimal performance. Our carefully designed video noise prior leads to substantially better performance. Extensive experimental validation shows that our model, Preserve Your Own COrrelation (PYoCo), attains SOTA zero-shot text-to-video results on the UCF-101 and MSR-VTT benchmarks. It also achieves SOTA video generation quality on the small-scale UCF-101 benchmark with a 10x smaller model using significantly less computation than the prior art.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Ge_Preserve_Your_Own_Correlation_A_Noise_Prior_for_Video_Diffusion_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Delta Denoising Score,"This paper introduces Delta Denoising Score (DDS), a novel diffusion-based scoring technique that optimizes a parametric model for the task of image editing. Unlike the existing Score Distillation Sampling (SDS), which queries the generative model with a single image-text pair, DDS utilizes an additional fixed query of a reference image-text pair to generate delta scores that represent the difference between the outputs of the two queries. 
 By estimating noisy gradient directions introduced by SDS using the source image and its text description, DDS provides cleaner gradient directions that modify the edited portions of the image while leaving others unchanged, yielding a distilled edit of the source image.
 The analysis presented in this paper supports the power of the new score for image-to-image translation. We further show that the new score can be used to train an effective zero-shot image translation model.
 The experimental results show that the proposed loss term outperforms existing methods in terms of stability and quality, highlighting its potential for real-world applications.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Hertz_Delta_Denoising_Score_ICCV_2023_paper.html
SuS-X: Training-Free Name-Only Transfer of Vision-Language Models,"Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has emerged as a simple yet effective way to train large-scale vision-language models. CLIP demonstrates impressive zero-shot classification and retrieval performance on diverse downstream tasks. However, to leverage its full potential, fine-tuning still appears to be necessary. Fine-tuning the entire CLIP model can be resource-intensive and unstable. Moreover, recent methods that aim to circumvent this need for fine-tuning still require access to images from the target distribution. In this paper, we pursue a different approach and explore the regime of training-free ""name-only transfer"" in which the only knowledge we possess about downstream tasks comprises the names of downstream target categories. We propose a novel method, SuS-X, consisting of two key building blocks--""SuS"" and ""TIP-X"", that requires neither intensive fine-tuning nor costly labelled data. SuS-X achieves state-of-the-art (SoTA) zero-shot classification results on 19 benchmark datasets. We further show the utility of TIP-X in the training-free few-shot setting, where we again achieve SoTA results over strong training-free baselines.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Udandarao_SuS-X_Training-Free_Name-Only_Transfer_of_Vision-Language_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Learning Cross-Modal Affinity for Referring Video Object Segmentation Targeting Limited Samples,"Referring video object segmentation (RVOS), as a supervised learning task, relies on sufficient annotated data for a given scene. However, in more realistic scenarios, only minimal annotations are available for a new scene, which poses significant challenges to existing RVOS methods. With this in mind, we propose a simple yet effective model with a newly designed cross-modal affinity (CMA) module based on a Transformer architecture. The CMA module builds multimodal affinity with a few samples, thus quickly learning new semantic information, and enabling the model to adapt to different scenarios. Since the proposed method targets limited samples for new scenes, we generalize the problem as - few-shot referring video object segmentation (FS-RVOS). To foster research in this direction, we build up a new FS-RVOS benchmark based on currently available datasets. The benchmark covers a wide range and includes multiple situations, which can maximally simulate real-world scenarios. Extensive experiments show that our model adapts well to different scenarios with only a few samples, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the benchmark. On Mini-Ref-YouTube-VOS, our model achieves an average performance of 53.1 J and 54.8 F, which are 10% better than the baselines. Furthermore, we show impressive results of 77.7 J and 74.8 F on Mini-Ref-SAIL-VOS, which are significantly better than the baselines.

Visually-Prompted Language Model for Fine-Grained Scene Graph Generation in an Open World,"Scene Graph Generation (SGG) aims to extract <subject, predicate, object> relationships in images for vision understanding. Although recent works have made steady progress on SGG, they still suffer long-tail distribution that tail-predicates are more costly to train and hard to distinguish due to a small amount of annotated data compared to frequent predicates. Existing re-balancing strategies try to handle it via prior rules but still are confined to pre-defined conditions, which are not scalable for various models and datasets. In this paper, we propose a Cross-modal prediCate boosting (CaCao) framework, where a visually-prompted language model is learned to generate diverse fine-grained predicates in a low-resource way. The proposed CaCao can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion and automatically strengthen existing SGG to tackle the long-tailed problem. Based on that, we further introduce a novel Entangled cross-modal prompt approach for open-world predicate scene graph generation (Epic), where models can generalize to unseen predicates in a zero-shot manner. Comprehensive experiments on three benchmark datasets show that CaCao consistently boosts the performance of multiple scene graph generation models in a model-agnostic way. Moreover, our Epic achieves competitive performance on open-world predicate prediction. The data and code for this paper are publicly available.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Yu_Visually-Prompted_Language_Model_for_Fine-Grained_Scene_Graph_Generation_in_an_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Open Set Video HOI detection from Action-Centric Chain-of-Look Prompting,"Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection is essential for understanding and modeling real-world events. Existing works on HOI detection mainly focus on static images and a closed setting, where all HOI classes are provided in the training set. In comparison, detecting HOIs in videos in open set scenarios is more challenging. First, under open set circumstances, HOI detectors are expected to hold strong generalizability to recognize unseen HOIs not included in the training data. Second, accurately capturing temporal contextual information from videos is difficult, but it is crucial for detecting temporal-related actions
 such as open, close, pull, push. To this end, we propose ACoLP, a model of Action-centric Chain-of-Look Prompting for open set video HOI detection. ACoLP regards actions as the carrier of semantics in videos, which captures the essential semantic information across frames. To make the model generalizable on unseen classes, inspired by the chain-of-thought prompting in natural language processing, we introduce the chain-of-look prompting scheme that decomposes prompt generation from large-scale vision-language model into a series of intermediate visual reasoning steps. Consequently, our model captures
 complex visual reasoning processes underlying the HOI events in videos, providing essential guidance for detecting unseen classes. Extensive experiments on two video HOI datasets, VidHOI and CAD120, demonstrate that ACoLP achieves competitive performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods in the conventional closed setting, and outperforms existing methods by a large margin in the open set setting.

Why Is Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models Robust to Noisy Labels?,"Vision-language models such as CLIP learn a generic text-image embedding from large-scale training data. A vision-language model can be adapted to a new classification task through few-shot prompt tuning. We find that such prompt tuning process is highly robust to label noises. This intrigues us to study the key reasons contributing to the robustness of the prompt tuning paradigm. We conducted extensive experiments to explore this property and find the key factors are: 1. the fixed classname tokens provide a strong regularization to the optimization of the model, reducing gradients induced by the noisy samples; 2. the powerful pre-trained image-text embedding that is learned from diverse and generic web data provides strong prior knowledge for image classification. Further, we demonstrate that noisy zero-shot predictions from CLIP can be used to tune its own prompt, significantly enhancing prediction accuracy in the unsupervised setting.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Wu_Why_Is_Prompt_Tuning_for_Vision-Language_Models_Robust_to_Noisy_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Not All Features Matter: Enhancing Few-shot CLIP with Adaptive Prior Refinement,"The popularity of Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has propelled its application to diverse downstream vision tasks. To improve its capacity on downstream tasks, few-shot learning has become a widely-adopted technique. However, existing methods either exhibit limited performance or suffer from excessive learnable parameters. In this paper, we propose APE, an Adaptive Prior rEfinement method for CLIP's pre-trained knowledge, which achieves superior accuracy with high computational efficiency. Via a prior refinement module, we analyze the inter-class disparity in the downstream data and decouple the domain-specific knowledge from the CLIP-extracted cache model. On top of that, we introduce two model variants, a training-free APE and a training-required APE-T. We explore the trilateral affinities between the test image, prior cache model, and textual representations, and only enable a lightweight category-residual module to be trained. For the average accuracy over 11 benchmarks, both APE and APE-T attain state-of-the-art and respectively outperform the second-best by +1.59% and +1.99% under 16 shots with x30 less learnable parameters.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhu_Not_All_Features_Matter_Enhancing_Few-shot_CLIP_with_Adaptive_Prior_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Read-only Prompt Optimization for Vision-Language Few-shot Learning,"In recent years, prompt tuning has proven effective in adapting pre-trained vision-language models to down- stream tasks. These methods aim to adapt the pre-trained models by introducing learnable prompts while keeping pre- trained weights frozen. However, learnable prompts can affect the internal representation within the self-attention module, which may negatively impact performance vari- ance and generalization, especially in data-deficient set- tings. To address these issues, we propose a novel ap- proach, Read-only Prompt Optimization (RPO). RPO lever- ages masked attention to prevent the internal representa- tion shift in the pre-trained model. Further, to facilitate the optimization of RPO, the read-only prompts are ini- tialized based on special tokens of the pre-trained model. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that RPO outper- forms CLIP and CoCoOp in base-to-new generalization and domain generalization while displaying better robust- ness. Also, the proposed method achieves better generaliza- tion on extremely data-deficient settings, while improving parameter efficiency and computational overhead. Code is

FateZero: Fusing Attentions for Zero-shot Text-based Video Editing,"The diffusion-based generative models have achieved remarkable success in text-based image generation. However, since it contains enormous randomness in generation progress, it is still challenging to apply such models for real-world visual content editing, especially in videos. In this paper, we propose FateZero, a zero-shot text-based editing method on real-world videos without per-prompt training or use-specific mask. To edit videos consistently, we propose several techniques based on the pre-trained models. Firstly, in contrast to the straightforward DDIM inversion technique, our approach captures intermediate attention maps during inversion, which effectively retain both structural and motion information. These maps are directly fused in the editing process rather than generated during denoising. To further minimize semantic leakage of the source video, we then fuse self-attentions with a blending mask obtained by cross-attention features from the source prompt. Furthermore, we have implemented a reform of the self-attention mechanism in denoising UNet by introducing spatial-temporal attention to ensure frame consistency. Yet succinct, our method is the first one to show the ability of zero-shot text-driven video style and local attribute editing from the trained text-to-image model. We also have a better zero-shot shape-aware editing ability in the text-to-video model.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/QI_FateZero_Fusing_Attentions_for_Zero-shot_Text-based_Video_Editing_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Unsupervised Prompt Tuning for Text-Driven Object Detection,"Grounded language-image pre-trained models have shown strong zero-shot generalization to various downstream object detection tasks. Despite their promising performance, the models rely heavily on the laborious prompt engineering. Existing works typically address this problem by tuning text prompts using downstream training data in a few-shot or fully supervised manner. However, a rarely studied problem is to optimize text prompts without using any annotations. In this paper, we delve into this problem and propose an Unsupervised Prompt Tuning framework for text-driven object detection, which is composed of two novel mean teaching mechanisms. In conventional mean teaching, the quality of pseudo boxes is expected to optimize better as the training goes on, but there is still a risk of overfitting noisy pseudo boxes. To mitigate this problem, 1) we propose Nested Mean Teaching, which adopts nested-annotation to supervise teacher-student mutual learning in a bi-level optimization manner; 2) we propose Dual Complementary Teaching, which employs an offline pre-trained teacher and an online mean teacher via data-augmentation-based complementary labeling so as to ensure learning without accumulating confirmation bias. By integrating these two mechanisms, the proposed unsupervised prompt tuning framework achieves significant performance improvement on extensive object detection datasets.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/He_Unsupervised_Prompt_Tuning_for_Text-Driven_Object_Detection_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Steered Diffusion: A Generalized Framework for Plug-and-Play Conditional Image Synthesis,"Conditional generative models typically demand large annotated training sets to achieve high-quality synthesis. As a result, there has been significant interest in designing models that perform plug-and-play generation, i.e., to use a predefined or pretrained model, which is not explicitly trained on the generative task, to guide the generative process (e.g., using language). However, such guidance is typically useful only towards synthesizing high-level semantics rather than editing fine-grained details as in image-to-image translation tasks. To this end, and capitalizing on the powerful fine-grained generative control offered by the recent diffusion-based generative models, we introduce Steered Diffusion, a generalized framework for photorealistic zero-shot conditional image generation using a diffusion model trained for unconditional generation. The key idea is to steer the image generation of the diffusion model at inference time via designing a loss using a pre-trained inverse model that characterizes the conditional task. This loss modulates the sampling trajectory of the diffusion process. Our framework allows for easy incorporation of multiple conditions during inference. We present experiments using steered diffusion on several tasks including inpainting, colorization, text-guided semantic editing, and image super-resolution. Our results demonstrate clear qualitative and quantitative improvements over state-of-the-art diffusion-based plug-and-play models while adding negligible additional computational cost.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Nair_Steered_Diffusion_A_Generalized_Framework_for_Plug-and-Play_Conditional_Image_Synthesis_ICCV_2023_paper.html
SATR: Zero-Shot Semantic Segmentation of 3D Shapes,"We explore the task of zero-shot semantic segmentation of 3D shapes by using large-scale off-the-shelf 2D im- age recognition models. Surprisingly, we find that modern zero-shot 2D object detectors are better suited for this task than contemporary text/image similarity predictors or even zero-shot 2D segmentation networks. Our key finding is that it is possible to extract accurate 3D segmentation maps from multi-view bounding box predictions by using the topological properties of the underlying surface. For this, we develop the Segmentation Assignment with Topological Reweighting (SATR) algorithm and evaluate it on ShapeNetPart and our proposed FAUST benchmarks. SATR achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms a baseline algorithm by 1.3% and 4% average mIoU on the FAUST coarse and fine-grained benchmarks, respectively, and by 5.2% average mIoU on the ShapeNetPart bench- mark. Our source code and data will be publicly released.

PODA: Prompt-driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation,"Domain adaptation has been vastly investigated in computer vision but still requires access to target images at train time, which might be intractable in some uncommon conditions. In this paper, we propose the task of 'Prompt-driven Zero-shot Domain Adaptation', where we adapt a model trained on a source domain using only a general description in natural language of the target domain, i.e., a prompt. First, we leverage a pretrained contrastive vision-language model (CLIP) to optimize affine transformations of source features, steering them towards the target text embedding while preserving their content and semantics. To achieve this, we propose Prompt-driven Instance Normalization (PIN). Second, we show that these prompt-driven augmentations can be used to perform zero-shot domain adaptation for semantic segmentation. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms CLIP-based style transfer baselines on several datasets for the downstream task at hand, even surpassing one-shot unsupervised domain adaptation. A similar boost is observed on object detection and image classification.

Prompt-aligned Gradient for Prompt Tuning,"Thanks to the large pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP, we can craft a zero-shot classifier by discrete prompt design, e.g., the confidence score of an image being ""[CLASS]"" can be obtained by using the VLM provided similarity between the image and the prompt sentence ""a photo of a [CLASS]"". Furthermore, prompting shows great potential for fast adaptation of VLMs to downstream tasks if we fine-tune the soft prompts with few samples. However, we find a common failure that improper fine-tuning or learning with extremely few-shot samples may even under-perform the zero-shot prediction. Existing methods still address this problem by using traditional anti-overfitting techniques such as early stopping and data augmentation, which lack a principled solution specific to prompting. In this paper, we present Prompt-aligned Gradient, dubbed ProGrad to prevent prompt tuning from forgetting the general knowledge learned from VLMs. In particular, ProGrad only updates the prompt whose gradient is aligned (or non-conflicting) to the general knowledge, which is represented as the optimization direction offered by the predefined prompt predictions. Extensive experiments under the few-shot learning, domain generalization, base-to-new generalization and cross-dataset transfer settings demonstrate
 the stronger few-shot generalization ability of ProGrad over state-of-the-art prompt tuning methods. Codes and theoretical proof are in Appendix.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Zhu_Prompt-aligned_Gradient_for_Prompt_Tuning_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Text2Video-Zero: Text-to-Image Diffusion Models are Zero-Shot Video Generators,"Recent text-to-video generation approaches rely on computationally heavy training and require large-scale video datasets. In this paper, we introduce a new task, zero-shot text-to-video generation, and propose a low-cost approach (without any training or optimization) by leveraging the power of existing text-to-image synthesis methods (e.g., Stable Diffusion), making them suitable for the video domain. 
  Our key modifications include (i) enriching the latent codes of the generated frames with motion dynamics to keep the global scene and the background time consistent; and (ii) reprogramming frame-level self-attention using a new cross-frame attention of each frame on the first frame, to preserve the context, appearance, and identity of the foreground object. 
  Experiments show that this leads to low overhead, yet high-quality and remarkably consistent video generation. Moreover, our approach is not limited to text-to-video synthesis but is also applicable to other tasks such as conditional and content-specialized video generation, and Video Instruct-Pix2Pix, i.e., instruction-guided video editing.
  As experiments show, our method performs comparably or sometimes better than recent approaches, despite not being trained on additional video data.

Knowledge-Aware Prompt Tuning for Generalizable Vision-Language Models,"Pre-trained vision-language models, e.g., CLIP, working with manually designed prompts have demonstrated great effectiveness in transfer learning. Recently, learnable prompts achieve state-of-the-art performance, which however are prone to overfit to seen classes while failing to generalize to unseen classes. In this paper, we propose a Knowledge-Aware Prompt Tuning (KAPT) framework for vision-language models. Our approach takes the inspiration from human intelligence in which external knowledge is usually incorporated into recognizing novel categories of objects. Specifically, we design two complementary types of knowledge-aware prompts for the text encoder to leverage the distinctive characteristics of category-related external knowledge. The discrete prompt extracts the key information from descriptions of an object category, and the learned continuous prompt captures overall contexts. We further design an adaptation head for the visual encoder to aggregate salient attentive visual cues, which establishes discriminative and task-aware visual representations. We conduct extensive experiments on 11 widely-used benchmark datasets and the results verify the effectiveness in few-shot image classification, especially in generalizing to unseen categories. Compared with the state-of-the-art CoCoOp method, KAPT exhibits favorable performance and achieves an absolute gain of 3.22% on new classes and 2.57% in terms of harmonic mean.",https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Kan_Knowledge-Aware_Prompt_Tuning_for_Generalizable_Vision-Language_Models_ICCV_2023_paper.html
Preventing Zero-Shot Transfer Degradation in Continual Learning of Vision-Language Models,"Continual learning (CL) can help pre-trained vision-language models efficiently adapt to new or under-trained data distributions without re-training. Nevertheless, during the continual training of the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) model, we observe that the model's zero-shot transfer ability significantly degrades due to catastrophic forgetting. Existing CL methods can mitigate forgetting by replaying previous data. However, since the CLIP dataset is private, replay methods cannot access the pre-training dataset. In addition, replaying data of previously learned downstream tasks can enhance their performance but comes at the cost of sacrificing zero-shot performance. To address this challenge, we propose a novel method ZSCL to prevent zero-shot transfer degradation in the continual learning of vision-language models in both feature and parameter space. In the feature space, a reference dataset is introduced for distillation between the current and initial models. The reference dataset should have semantic diversity but no need to be labeled, seen in pre-training, or matched image-text pairs. In parameter space, we prevent a large parameter shift by averaging weights during the training. We propose a more challenging Multi-domain Task Incremental Learning (MTIL) benchmark to evaluate different methods, where tasks are from various domains instead of class-separated in a single dataset. Our method outperforms other methods in the traditional class-incremental learning setting and the MTIL by 9.7% average score.
